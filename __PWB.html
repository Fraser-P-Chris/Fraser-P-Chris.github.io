<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-3F3 href=#$3F3>1</a></sup></font></sup> He also said to them, &quot;Amen, I say to
you, there are some standing here who will not taste death until they see that
the kingdom of God has come in power.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-3F4 href=#$3F4>2</a></sup></font></sup> After six days Jesus took Peter, James, and
John and led them up a high mountain apart by themselves. And he was
transfigured before them, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>3
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>and his clothes became dazzling white, such as
no fuller on earth could bleach them. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>4
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then Elijah appeared to them along with Moses,
and they were conversing with Jesus. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>5
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-3F5 href=#$3F5>3</a></sup></font></sup> Then Peter said to Jesus in reply,
&quot;Rabbi, it is good that we are here! Let us make three tents: one for you,
one for Moses, and one for Elijah.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>6
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>He hardly knew what to say, they were so
terrified. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>7
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then a cloud came, casting a shadow over them; <sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-3F6 href=#$3F6>4</a></sup></font></sup>
then from the cloud came a voice, &quot;This is my beloved Son. Listen to
him.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>8
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Suddenly, looking around, they no longer saw
anyone but Jesus alone with them. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>9
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-3F7 href=#$3F7>5</a></sup></font></sup> As they were coming down from the mountain, he
charged them not to relate what they had seen to anyone, except when the Son of
Man had risen from the dead. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>10
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>So they kept the matter to themselves,
questioning what rising from the dead meant. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>11
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then they asked him, &quot;Why do the scribes
say that Elijah must come first?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>12
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>He told them, &quot;Elijah will indeed come
first and restore all things, yet how is it written regarding the Son of Man
that he must suffer greatly and be treated with contempt? </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>13
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But I tell you that Elijah has come and they
did to him whatever they pleased, as it is written of him.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>14
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-3F8 href=#$3F8>6</a></sup></font></sup> When they came to the disciples, they saw a
large crowd around them and scribes arguing with them. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>15
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Immediately on seeing him, the whole crowd was
utterly amazed. They ran up to him and greeted him. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>16
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>He asked them, &quot;What are you arguing about
with them?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>17
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Someone from the crowd answered him,
&quot;Teacher, I have brought to you my son possessed by a mute spirit. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>18
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Wherever it seizes him, it throws him down; he
foams at the mouth, grinds his teeth, and becomes rigid. I asked your disciples
to drive it out, but they were unable to do so.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>19
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>He said to them in reply, &quot;O faithless
generation, how long will I be with you? How long will I endure you? Bring him
to me.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>20
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>They brought the boy to him. And when he saw
him, the spirit immediately threw the boy into convulsions. As he fell to the
ground, he began to roll around and foam at the mouth. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>21
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then he questioned his father, &quot;How long
has this been happening to him?&quot; He replied, &quot;Since childhood. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>22
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>It has often thrown him into fire and into
water to kill him. But if you can do anything, have compassion on us and help
us.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>23
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Jesus said to him, &quot; 'If you can!'
Everything is possible to one who has faith.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>24
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then the boy's father cried out, &quot;I do
believe, help my unbelief!&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>25
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Jesus, on seeing a crowd rapidly gathering, rebuked
the unclean spirit and said to it, &quot;Mute and deaf spirit, I command you:
come out of him and never enter him again!&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>26
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Shouting and throwing the boy into convulsions,
it came out. He became like a corpse, which caused many to say, &quot;He is
dead!&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>27
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But Jesus took him by the hand, raised him, and
he stood up. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>28
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When he entered the house, his disciples asked
him in private, &quot;Why could we not drive it out?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>29
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-3F9 href=#$3F9>7</a></sup></font></sup> He said to them, &quot;This kind can only come
out through prayer.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>30
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>They left from there and began a journey
through Galilee, but he did not wish anyone to know about it. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>31
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>He was teaching his disciples and telling them,
&quot;The Son of Man is to be handed over to men and they will kill him, and
three days after his death he will rise.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>32
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But they did not understand the saying, and
they were afraid to question him. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>33
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-3FA href=#$3FA>8</a></sup></font></sup> They came to Capernaum and, once inside the
house, he began to ask them, &quot;What were you arguing about on the
way?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>34
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But they remained silent. They had been
discussing among themselves on the way who was the greatest. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>35
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then he sat down, called the Twelve, and said
to them, &quot;If anyone wishes to be first, he shall be the last of all and
the servant of all.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>36
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Taking a child he placed it in their midst, and
putting his arms around it he said to them, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>37
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;Whoever receives one child such as this
in my name, receives me; and whoever receives me, receives not me but the one
who sent me.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>38
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-3FB href=#$3FB>9</a></sup></font></sup> John said to him, &quot;Teacher, we saw
someone driving out demons in your name, and we tried to prevent him because he
does not follow us.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>39
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Jesus replied, &quot;Do not prevent him. There
is no one who performs a mighty deed in my name who can at the same time speak
ill of me. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>40
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>For whoever is not against us is for us. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>41

19:16-<A href=__P21.html#PENT.EXO.20.17><b>&#8658;</b></A> 20:17; <A href=__P8X.html#HIS.1KIN.19.2><b>&#8658;</b></A> 1
Kings 19:2, <A href=__P8X.html#HIS.1KIN.19.8><b>&#8658;</b></A> 8-14. They now appear with
Jesus as witnesses to the fulfillment of the law and the prophets taking place
in the person of Jesus as he appears in glory.</p>

<p><sup></sup></p><br><br></font><font size=3><b><a name=$3F6 href=#-3F6>4</a></b></font><font face=Verdana size=1><sup></sup> [7] A cloud came, casting a shadow
over them: even the disciples enter into the mystery of his glorification. In
the Old Testament the cloud covered the meeting tent, indicating the Lord's
presence in the midst of his people (<A href=__P2L.html#PENT.EXO.40.34><b>&#8658;</b></A> Exodus
40:34-35) and came to rest upon the temple in Jerusalem at the time
of its dedication (<A href=__P8M.html#HIS.1KIN.8.10><b>&#8658;</b></A> 1 Kings 8:10).</p>

<p><sup></sup></p><br><br></font><font size=3><b><a name=$3F7 href=#-3F7>5</a></b></font><font face=Verdana size=1><sup></sup> [9-13] At the transfiguration of
Jesus his disciples had seen Elijah. They were perplexed because, according to
the rabbinical interpretation of <A href=__PV5.html#PROPHB.MAL.3.23><b>&#8658;</b></A> Malachi 3:23-24,
Elijah was to come first. Jesus' response shows that Elijah has come, in the
person of John the Baptist, to prepare for the day of the Lord. Jesus must
suffer greatly and be treated with contempt (<A href=__PWB.html#GOSP.MAR.9.12><b>&#8658;</b></A> Mark
9:12) like the Baptist (<A href=__PWB.html#GOSP.MAR.9.13><b>&#8658;</b></A> Mark 9:13); cf
<A href=__PW8.html#GOSP.MAR.6.17><b>&#8658;</b></A> Mark 6:17-29.</p>

<p><sup></sup></p><br><br></font><font size=3><b><a name=$3F8 href=#-3F8>6</a></b></font><font face=Verdana size=1><sup></sup> [14-29] The disciples' failure to
effect a cure seems to reflect unfavorably on Jesus (<A href=__PWB.html#GOSP.MAR.9.14><b>&#8658;</b></A> Mark
9:14-18, <A href=__PWB.html#GOSP.MAR.9.22><b>&#8658;</b></A> 22). In response Jesus exposes
their lack of trust in God (<A href=__PW6.html#GOSP.MAR.4.19><b>&#8658;</b></A> Mark 4:19) and scores
their lack of prayer (<A href=__PW6.html#GOSP.MAR.4.29><b>&#8658;</b></A> Mark 4:29), i.e., of
conscious reliance on God's power when acting in Jesus' name. For Matthew, see
the note on <A href=__PVQ.html#GOSP.MAT.17.14><b>&#8658;</b></A> Matthew 17:14-20. <A href=__PWS.html#GOSP.LUK.9.37><b>&#8658;</b></A> Luke
9:37-43 centers attention on Jesus' sovereign power.</p>

<p><sup></sup></p><br><br></font><font size=3><b><a name=$3F9 href=#-3F9>7</a></b></font><font face=Verdana size=1><sup></sup> [29] This kind can only come out
through prayer: a variant reading adds &quot;and through fasting.&quot;</p>

<p><sup></sup></p><br><br></font><font size=3><b><a name=$3FA href=#-3FA>8</a></b></font><font face=Verdana size=1><sup></sup> [33-37] Mark probably intends this incident
and the sayings that follow as commentary on the disciples' lack of
understanding (<A href=__PWB.html#GOSP.MAR.9.32><b>&#8658;</b></A> Mark 9:32). Their role in Jesus'
work is one of service, especially to the poor and lowly. Children were the
symbol Jesus used for the anawim, the poor in spirit, the lowly in the
Christian community.</p>

<p><sup></sup></p><br><br></font><font size=3><b><a name=$3FB href=#-3FB>9</a></b></font><font face=Verdana size=1><sup></sup> [38-41] Jesus warns against
jealousy and intolerance toward others, such as exorcists who do not follow us.
The saying in <A href=__PWB.html#GOSP.MAR.9.40><b>&#8658;</b></A> Mark 9:40 is a broad principle of
the divine tolerance. Even the smallest courtesies shown to those who teach in
Jesus' name do not go unrewarded.</p>

<p><sup></sup></p><br><br></font><font size=3><b><a name=$3FC href=#-3FC>10</a></b></font><font face=Verdana size=1><sup></sup> [43,45,47] Gehenna: see the note on
<A href=__PVE.html#GOSP.MAT.5.22><b>&#8658;</b></A> Matthew 5:22.</p>

<p><sup></sup></p><br><br></font><font size=3><b><a name=$3FD href=#-3FD>11</a></b></font><font face=Verdana size=1><sup></sup> [44,46] These verses, lacking in
some important early manuscripts, are here omitted as scribal additions. They
simply repeat <A href=__PWB.html#GOSP.MAR.9.48><b>&#8658;</b></A> Mark 9:48 itself a modified citation
of <A href=__PPD.html#PROPHB.ISA.66.24><b>&#8658;</b></A> Isaiah 66:24.</p>

<p><sup></sup></p><br><br></font><font size=3><b><a name=$3FE href=#-3FE>12</a></b></font><font face=Verdana size=1><sup></sup> [49] Everyone will be salted with
fire: so the better manuscripts. Some add &quot;every sacrifice will be salted
with salt.&quot; The purifying and preservative use of salt in food
(<A href=__P2O.html#PENT.LEV.2.13><b>&#8658;</b></A> Lev 2:13) and the refinement effected through
fire refer here to comparable effects in the spiritual life of the disciples of
Jesus.</p>
