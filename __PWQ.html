his words to the people, he entered Capernaum. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>A centurion <sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-3JY href=#$3JY>3</a></sup></font></sup> there had a slave
who was ill and about to die, and he was valuable to him. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>3
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When he heard about Jesus, he sent elders of
the Jews to him, asking him to come and save the life of his slave. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>4
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>They approached Jesus and strongly urged him to
come, saying, &quot;He deserves to have you do this for him, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>5
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>for he loves our nation and he built the
synagogue for us.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>6
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>And Jesus went with them, but when he was only
a short distance from the house, the centurion sent friends to tell him,
&quot;Lord, do not trouble yourself, for I am not worthy to have you enter
under my roof. <sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-3JZ href=#$3JZ>4</a></sup></font></sup> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>7
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Therefore, I did not consider myself worthy to
come to you; but say the word and let my servant be healed. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>8
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>For I too am a person subject to authority,
with soldiers subject to me. And I say to one, 'Go,' and he goes; and to
another, 'Come here,' and he comes; and to my slave, 'Do this,' and he does
it.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>9
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When Jesus heard this he was amazed at him and,
turning, said to the crowd following him, &quot;I tell you, not even in Israel
have I found such faith.&quot; </p>

</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When the messengers returned to the house, they

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>As he drew near to the gate of the city, a man
who had died was being carried out, the only son of his mother, and she was a
widow. A large crowd from the city was with her. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>13
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When the Lord saw her, he was moved with pity
for her and said to her, &quot;Do not weep.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>14
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>He stepped forward and touched the coffin; at
this the bearers halted, and he said, &quot;Young man, I tell you, arise!&quot;
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>15
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The dead man sat up and began to speak, and
Jesus gave him to his mother. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>16
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Fear seized them all, and they glorified God,
exclaiming, &quot;A great prophet has arisen in our midst,&quot; and &quot;God
has visited his people.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>17
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>This report about him spread through the whole
of Judea and in all the surrounding region. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-3K1 href=#$3K1>6</a></sup></font></sup> The disciples of John told him about all these
things. John summoned two of his disciples </p>

</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>and sent them to the Lord to ask, &quot;Are you
the one who is to come, or should we look for another?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>20
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When the men came to him, they said, &quot;John
the Baptist has sent us to you to ask, 'Are you the one who is to come, or
should we look for another?'&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>21
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>At that time he cured many of their diseases,
sufferings, and evil spirits; he also granted sight to many who were blind. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>22
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>And he said to them in reply, &quot;Go and tell
John what you have seen and heard: the blind regain their sight, the lame walk,
lepers are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are raised, the poor have the good
news proclaimed to them. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>23

desert to see - a reed swayed by the wind? </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>25

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then what did you go out to see? Someone
dressed in fine garments? Those who dress luxuriously and live sumptuously are
found in royal palaces. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>26

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then what did you go out to see? A prophet?
Yes, I tell you, and more than a prophet. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>27

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>I tell you, among those born of women, no one
is greater than John; yet the least in the kingdom of God is greater than
he.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>(All the people who listened, including the tax
collectors, and who were baptized with the baptism of John, acknowledged the

marketplace and call to one another, 'We played the flute for you, but you did
not dance. We sang a dirge, but you did not weep.' </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>33
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>For John the Baptist came neither eating food

<p><sup></sup></p><br><br></font><font size=3><b><a name=$3JX href=#-3JX>2</a></b></font><font face=Verdana size=1><sup></sup> [1-10] This story about the faith
of the centurion, a Gentile who cherishes the Jewish nation
(<A href=__PWQ.html#GOSP.LUK.7.5><b>&#8658;</b></A> Luke 7:5), prepares for the story in Acts of the
conversion by Peter of the Roman centurion Cornelius who is similarly described
as one who is generous to the Jewish nation (<A href=__PY4.html#GOSP.ACT.10.2><b>&#8658;</b></A> Acts
10:2). See also <A href=__PY4.html#GOSP.ACT.10.34><b>&#8658;</b></A> Acts 10:34-35 in the
speech of Peter: &quot;God shows no partiality . . . the person who fears him
and acts righteously is acceptable to him.&quot; See also the notes on
<A href=__PVH.html#GOSP.MAT.8.5><b>&#8658;</b></A> Matthew 8:5-13 and <A href=__PXC.html#GOSP.JOH.4.43><b>&#8658;</b></A> John
4:43-54. </p>

<p><sup></sup></p><br><br></font><font size=3><b><a name=$3JY href=#-3JY>3</a></b></font><font face=Verdana size=1><sup></sup> [2] A centurion: see the note on <A href=__PVH.html#GOSP.MAT.8.5><b>&#8658;</b></A> Matthew
8:5.</p>

<p><sup></sup></p><br><br></font><font size=3><b><a name=$3JZ href=#-3JZ>4</a></b></font><font face=Verdana size=1><sup></sup> [6] I am not worthy to have you
enter under my roof: to enter the house of a Gentile was considered unclean for
a Jew; cf <A href=__PY4.html#GOSP.ACT.10.28><b>&#8658;</b></A> Acts 10:28.</p>

<p><sup></sup></p><br><br></font><font size=3><b><a name=$3K0 href=#-3K0>5</a></b></font><font face=Verdana size=1><sup></sup> [11-17] In the previous incident
Jesus' power was displayed for a Gentile whose servant was dying; in this
episode it is displayed toward a widowed mother whose only son has already
died. Jesus' power over death prepares for his reply to John's disciples in
<A href=__PWQ.html#GOSP.LUK.7.22><b>&#8658;</b></A> Luke 7:22: &quot;the dead are raised.&quot; This
resuscitation in alluding to the prophet Elijah's resurrection of the only son
of a widow of Zarephath (<A href=__P8L.html#HIS.1KIN.7.8><b>&#8658;</b></A> 1 Kings 7:8-24) leads to
the reaction of the crowd: &quot;A great prophet has arisen in our midst&quot;
(<A href=__PWQ.html#GOSP.LUK.7.16><b>&#8658;</b></A> Luke 7:16).</p>

<p><sup></sup></p><br><br></font><font size=3><b><a name=$3K1 href=#-3K1>6</a></b></font><font face=Verdana size=1><sup></sup> [18-23] In answer to John's
question, Are you the one who is to come? - a probable reference to the return
of the fiery prophet of reform, Elijah, &quot;before the day of the Lord comes,
the great and terrible day&quot; (<A href=__PV5.html#PROPHB.MAL.3.23><b>&#8658;</b></A> Malachi 3:23) -
Jesus responds that his role is rather to bring the blessings spoken of in
<A href=__PP8.html#PROPHB.ISA.61.1><b>&#8658;</b></A> Isaiah 61:1 to the oppressed and neglected of
society (<A href=__PWQ.html#GOSP.LUK.7.22><b>&#8658;</b></A> Luke 7:22; cf <A href=__PWN.html#GOSP.LUK.4.18><b>&#8658;</b></A> Luke
4:18).</p>

<p><sup></sup></p><br><br></font><font size=3><b><a name=$3K2 href=#-3K2>7</a></b></font><font face=Verdana size=1><sup></sup> [23] Blessed is the one who takes
no offense at me: this beatitude is pronounced on the person who recognizes
Jesus' true identity in spite of previous expectations of what &quot;the one
who is to come&quot; would be like.</p>

<p><sup></sup></p><br><br></font><font size=3><b><a name=$3K3 href=#-3K3>8</a></b></font><font face=Verdana size=1><sup></sup> [24-30] In his testimony to John,
Jesus reveals his understanding of the relationship between them: John is the
precursor of Jesus (<A href=__PWQ.html#GOSP.LUK.7.27><b>&#8658;</b></A> Luke 7:27); John is the
messenger spoken of in <A href=__PV5.html#PROPHB.MAL.3.1><b>&#8658;</b></A> Malachi 3:1 who in
<A href=__PV5.html#PROPHB.MAL.3.23><b>&#8658;</b></A> Malachi 3:23 is identified as Elijah. Taken with
the previous episode, it can be seen that Jesus identifies John as precisely
the person John envisioned Jesus to be: the Elijah who prepares the way for the
coming of the day of the Lord.</p>

<p><sup></sup></p><br><br></font><font size=3><b><a name=$3K4 href=#-3K4>9</a></b></font><font face=Verdana size=1><sup></sup> [31-35] See the note on
<A href=__PVK.html#GOSP.MAT.11.16><b>&#8658;</b></A> Matthew 11:16-19.</p>

<p><sup></sup></p><br><br></font><font size=3><b><a name=$3K5 href=#-3K5>10</a></b></font><font face=Verdana size=1><sup></sup> [36-50] In this story of the
pardoning of the sinful woman Luke presents two different reactions to the
ministry of Jesus. A Pharisee, suspecting Jesus to be a prophet, invites Jesus
to a festive banquet in his house, but the Pharisee's self-righteousness leads
to little forgiveness by God and consequently little love shown toward Jesus.
The sinful woman, on the other hand, manifests a faith in God
(<A href=__PWQ.html#GOSP.LUK.7.50><b>&#8658;</b></A> Luke 7:50) that has led her to seek forgiveness
for her sins, and because so much was forgiven, she now overwhelms Jesus with
her display of love; cf the similar contrast in attitudes in <A href=__PX1.html#GOSP.LUK.18.9><b>&#8658;</b></A> Luke
18:9-14. The whole episode is a powerful lesson on the relation
between forgiveness and love.</p>

<p><sup></sup></p><br><br></font><font size=3><b><a name=$3K6 href=#-3K6>11</a></b></font><font face=Verdana size=1><sup></sup> [36] Reclined at table: the normal
posture of guests at a banquet. Other oriental banquet customs alluded to in
this story include the reception by the host with a kiss
(<A href=__PWQ.html#GOSP.LUK.7.45><b>&#8658;</b></A> Luke 7:45), washing the feet of the guests
(<A href=__PWQ.html#GOSP.LUK.7.44><b>&#8658;</b></A> Luke 7:44), and the anointing of the guests'
heads (<A href=__PWQ.html#GOSP.LUK.7.46><b>&#8658;</b></A> Luke 7:46).</p>

<p><sup></sup></p><br><br></font><font size=3><b><a name=$3K7 href=#-3K7>12</a></b></font><font face=Verdana size=1><sup></sup> [41] Days' wages: one denarius is
the normal daily wage of a laborer.</p>

<p><sup></sup></p><br><br></font><font size=3><b><a name=$3K8 href=#-3K8>13</a></b></font><font face=Verdana size=1><sup></sup> [47] Her many sins have been
forgiven; hence, she has shown great love: literally, &quot;her many sins have
been forgiven, seeing that she has loved much.&quot; That the woman's sins have
been forgiven is attested by the great love she shows toward Jesus. Her love is
the consequence of her forgiveness. This is also the meaning demanded by the
parable in <A href=__PWQ.html#GOSP.LUK.7.41><b>&#8658;</b></A> Luke 7:41-43.</p>
