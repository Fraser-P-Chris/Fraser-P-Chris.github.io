follow Cyrus are uncertain, since there were more than three Persian kings
between Cyrus and the dissolution of the kingdom. The fourth is doubtless
Xerxes I (486-465 B.C.), the great campaigner against Greece. The powerful king
is Alexander the Great, who ended the Persian empire by his victory at Issus in

Hellenistic empire that were of interest to the author
(<A href=PSW.html#PROPHB.DAN.11.6><b>&#8658;</b></A> Daniel 11:6). In <A href=PSW.html#PROPHB.DAN.11.10><b>&#8658;</b></A> Daniel
11:10-20 is described the struggle between the two kingdoms for the
control of Palestine, in which the Seleucids were eventually victorious. The
reference in <A href=PSW.html#PROPHB.DAN.11.20><b>&#8658;</b></A> Daniel 11:20 is to Seleucus IV, who
sent Heliodorus to plunder the temple treasure in Jerusalem (2 Macc 3).
Finally, <A href=PSW.html#PROPHB.DAN.11.21><b>&#8658;</b></A> Daniel 11:21-45 describe the career of
