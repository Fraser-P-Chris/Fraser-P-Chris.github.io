</p>

<p class="MsoNormal main_text_block"><sup><font class="verdana_size_2"><sup><a name=-42I href=#$42I>1</a></sup></font></sup> Now there were in the church at Antioch
prophets and teachers: Barnabas, Symeon who was called Niger, Lucius of Cyrene,
Manaen who was a close friend of Herod the tetrarch, and Saul. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2
</p>

<p class="MsoNormal main_text_block">While they were worshiping the Lord and
fasting, the holy Spirit said, &quot;Set apart for me Barnabas and Saul for the
work to which I have called them.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>3
</p>

<p class="MsoNormal main_text_block">Then, completing their fasting and prayer, they
laid hands on them and sent them off. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>4
</p>

<p class="MsoNormal main_text_block"><sup><font class="verdana_size_2"><sup><a name=-42J href=#$42J>2</a></sup></font></sup> So they, sent forth by the holy Spirit, went
down to Seleucia and from there sailed to Cyprus. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>5
</p>

<p class="MsoNormal main_text_block">When they arrived in Salamis, they proclaimed
the word of God in the Jewish synagogues. They had John <sup><font class="verdana_size_2"><sup><a name=-42K href=#$42K>3</a></sup></font></sup>
also as their assistant. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>6
</p>

<p class="MsoNormal main_text_block">When they had traveled through the whole island
as far as Paphos, they met a magician named Bar-Jesus who was a Jewish false
prophet. <sup><font class="verdana_size_2"><sup><a name=-42L href=#$42L>4</a></sup></font></sup> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>7
</p>

<p class="MsoNormal main_text_block">He was with the proconsul Sergius Paulus, a man
of intelligence, who had summoned Barnabas and Saul and wanted to hear the word
of God. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>8
</p>

<p class="MsoNormal main_text_block">But Elymas the magician (for that is what his
name means) opposed them in an attempt to turn the proconsul away from the
faith. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>9
</p>

<p class="MsoNormal main_text_block">But Saul, also known as Paul, <sup><font class="verdana_size_2"><sup><a name=-42M href=#$42M>5</a></sup></font></sup>
filled with the holy Spirit, looked intently at him </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>10
</p>

<p class="MsoNormal main_text_block">and said, &quot;You son of the devil, you enemy
of all that is right, full of every sort of deceit and fraud. Will you not stop
twisting the straight paths of (the) Lord? </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>11
</p>

<p class="MsoNormal main_text_block">Even now the hand of the Lord is upon you. You
will be blind, and unable to see the sun for a time.&quot; Immediately a dark
mist fell upon him, and he went about seeking people to lead him by the hand. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>12
</p>

<p class="MsoNormal main_text_block">When the proconsul saw what had happened, he
came to believe, for he was astonished by the teaching about the Lord. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>13
</p>

<p class="MsoNormal main_text_block">From Paphos, Paul and his companions set sail
and arrived at Perga in Pamphylia. But John left them and returned to
Jerusalem. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>14
</p>

<p class="MsoNormal main_text_block">They continued on from Perga and reached
Antioch in Pisidia. On the sabbath they entered (into) the synagogue and took
their seats. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>15
</p>

<p class="MsoNormal main_text_block">After the reading of the law and the prophets,
the synagogue officials sent word to them, &quot;My brothers, if one of you has
a word of exhortation for the people, please speak.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>16
</p>

<p class="MsoNormal main_text_block"><sup><font class="verdana_size_2"><sup><a name=-42N href=#$42N>6</a></sup></font></sup> So Paul got up, motioned with his hand, and
said, &quot;Fellow Israelites and you others who are God-fearing, <sup><font class="verdana_size_2"><sup><a name=-42O href=#$42O>7</a></sup></font></sup>
listen. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>17
</p>

<p class="MsoNormal main_text_block">The God of this people Israel chose our
ancestors and exalted the people during their sojourn in the land of Egypt.
With uplifted arm he led them out of it </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>18
</p>

<p class="MsoNormal main_text_block">and for about forty years he put up with <sup><font class="verdana_size_2"><sup><a name=-42P href=#$42P>8</a></sup></font></sup>
them in the desert. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>19
</p>

<p class="MsoNormal main_text_block">When he had destroyed seven nations in the land
of Canaan, he gave them their land as an inheritance </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>20
</p>

<p class="MsoNormal main_text_block">at the end of about four hundred and fifty
years. <sup><font class="verdana_size_2"><sup><a name=-42Q href=#$42Q>9</a></sup></font></sup> After these things he provided judges up to Samuel (the)
prophet. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>21
</p>

<p class="MsoNormal main_text_block">Then they asked for a king. God gave them Saul,
son of Kish, a man from the tribe of Benjamin, for forty years. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>22
</p>

<p class="MsoNormal main_text_block">Then he removed him and raised up David as
their king; of him he testified, 'I have found David, son of Jesse, a man after
my own heart; he will carry out my every wish.' </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>23
</p>

<p class="MsoNormal main_text_block">From this man's descendants God, according to
his promise, has brought to Israel a savior, Jesus. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>24
</p>

<p class="MsoNormal main_text_block">John heralded his coming by proclaiming a
baptism of repentance to all the people of Israel; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>25
</p>

<p class="MsoNormal main_text_block">and as John was completing his course, he would
say, 'What do you suppose that I am? I am not he. Behold, one is coming after
me; I am not worthy to unfasten the sandals of his feet.' </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>26
</p>

<p class="MsoNormal main_text_block">&quot;My brothers, children of the family of
Abraham, and those others among you who are God-fearing, to us this word of
salvation has been sent. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>27
</p>

<p class="MsoNormal main_text_block">The inhabitants of Jerusalem and their leaders
failed to recognize him, and by condemning him they fulfilled the oracles of
the prophets that are read sabbath after sabbath. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>28
</p>

<p class="MsoNormal main_text_block">For even though they found no grounds for a
death sentence, they asked Pilate to have him put to death, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>29
</p>

<p class="MsoNormal main_text_block">and when they had accomplished all that was
written about him, they took him down from the tree and placed him in a tomb. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>30
</p>

<p class="MsoNormal main_text_block">But God raised him from the dead, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>31
</p>

<p class="MsoNormal main_text_block">and for many days he appeared to those who had
come up with him from Galilee to Jerusalem. These are (now) his witnesses
before the people. <sup><font class="verdana_size_2"><sup><a name=-42R href=#$42R>10</a></sup></font></sup> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>32
</p>

<p class="MsoNormal main_text_block">We ourselves are proclaiming this good news to
you that what God promised our ancestors </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>33
</p>

<p class="MsoNormal main_text_block">he has brought to fulfillment for us, (their)
children, by raising up Jesus, as it is written in the second psalm, 'You are
my son; this day I have begotten you.' </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>34
</p>

<p class="MsoNormal main_text_block">And that he raised him from the dead never to
return to corruption he declared in this way, 'I shall give you the benefits
assured to David.' </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>35
</p>

<p class="MsoNormal main_text_block">That is why he also says in another psalm, 'You
will not suffer your holy one to see corruption.' </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>36
</p>

<p class="MsoNormal main_text_block">Now David, after he had served the will of God
in his lifetime, fell asleep, was gathered to his ancestors, and did see
corruption. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>37
</p>

<p class="MsoNormal main_text_block">But the one whom God raised up did not see
corruption. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>38
</p>

<p class="MsoNormal main_text_block">You must know, my brothers, that through him
forgiveness of sins is being proclaimed to you, (and) in regard to everything
from which you could not be justified <sup><font class="verdana_size_2"><sup><a name=-42S href=#$42S>11</a></sup></font></sup> under the law of
Moses, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>39
</p>

<p class="MsoNormal main_text_block">in him every believer is justified. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>40
</p>

<p class="MsoNormal main_text_block">Be careful, then, that what was said in the
prophets not come about: </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>41
</p>

<p class="MsoNormal main_text_block">'Look on, you scoffers, be amazed and
disappear. For I am doing a work in your days, a work that you will never
believe even if someone tells you.'&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>42
</p>

<p class="MsoNormal main_text_block">As they were leaving, they invited them to
speak on these subjects the following sabbath. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>43
</p>

<p class="MsoNormal main_text_block">After the congregation had dispersed, many Jews
and worshipers who were converts to Judaism followed Paul and Barnabas, who
spoke to them and urged them to remain faithful to the grace of God. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>44
</p>

<p class="MsoNormal main_text_block">On the following sabbath almost the whole city
gathered to hear the word of the Lord. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>45
</p>

<p class="MsoNormal main_text_block">When the Jews saw the crowds, they were filled with
jealousy and with violent abuse contradicted what Paul said. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>46
</p>

<p class="MsoNormal main_text_block">Both Paul and Barnabas spoke out boldly and
said, &quot;It was necessary that the word of God be spoken to you first, but
since you reject it and condemn yourselves as unworthy of eternal life, we now
turn to the Gentiles. <sup><font class="verdana_size_2"><sup><a name=-42T href=#$42T>12</a></sup></font></sup> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>47
</p>

<p class="MsoNormal main_text_block">For so the Lord has commanded us, 'I have made
you a light to the Gentiles, that you may be an instrument of salvation to the
ends of the earth.'&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>48
</p>

<p class="MsoNormal main_text_block">The Gentiles were delighted when they heard
this and glorified the word of the Lord. All who were destined for eternal life
came to believe, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>49
</p>

<p class="MsoNormal main_text_block">and the word of the Lord continued to spread
through the whole region. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>50
</p>

<p class="MsoNormal main_text_block">The Jews, however, incited the women of
prominence who were worshipers and the leading men of the city, stirred up a
persecution against Paul and Barnabas, and expelled them from their territory. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>51
</p>

<p class="MsoNormal main_text_block">So they shook the dust from their feet in protest
against them and went to Iconium. <sup><font class="verdana_size_2"><sup><a name=-42U href=#$42U>13</a></sup></font></sup> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>52
</p>

<p class="MsoNormal main_text_block">The disciples were filled with joy and the holy
Spirit. </p>

was a Jewish false prophet: that is, he posed as a prophet. Again Luke takes
the opportunity to dissociate Christianity from the magical acts of the time
(<A href=PY7.html#GOSP.ACT.13.7><b>&#8658;</b></A> Acts 13:7-11); see also <A href=PY2.html#GOSP.ACT.8.18><b>&#8658;</b></A> Acts

is no reason to believe that his name was changed from Saul to Paul upon his
conversion. The use of a double name, one Semitic (Saul), the other Greco-Roman
(Paul), is well attested (cf <A href=PXV.html#GOSP.ACT.1.23><b>&#8658;</b></A> Acts 1:23 Joseph
Justus; <A href=PY6.html#GOSP.ACT.12.12><b>&#8658;</b></A> Acts 12:12,

speeches of Paul to Jews proclaiming that the Christian church is the logical
development of Pharisaic Judaism (see also <A href=PYI.html#GOSP.ACT.24.10><b>&#8658;</b></A> Acts

<p><sup></sup></p><br><br></font><font class="second_size_3"><b><a name=$42Q href=#-42Q>9</a></b></font><font class="verdana_size_1"><sup></sup> [20] At the end of about four
hundred and fifty years: the manuscript tradition makes it uncertain whether
the mention of four hundred and fifty years refers to the sojourn in Egypt
before the Exodus, the wilderness period and the time of the conquest (see
<A href=P1T.html#PENT.EXO.12.40><b>&#8658;</b></A> Exodus 12:40-41), as the translation here
suggests, or to the time between the conquest and the time of Samuel, the
period of the judges, if the text is read, &quot;After these things, for about
four hundred and fifty years, he provided judges.&quot;</p>

<p><sup></sup></p><br><br></font><font class="second_size_3"><b><a name=$42R href=#-42R>10</a></b></font><font class="verdana_size_1"><sup></sup> [31] The theme of the Galilean
witnesses is a major one in the Gospel of Luke and in Acts and is used to
signify the continuity between the teachings of Jesus and the teachings of the
church and to guarantee the fidelity of the church's teachings to the words of
Jesus.</p>

<p><sup></sup></p><br><br></font><font class="second_size_3"><b><a name=$42S href=#-42S>11</a></b></font><font class="verdana_size_1"><sup></sup> [38-39] Justified: the verb is the
same as that used in Paul's letters to speak of the experience of justification
and, as in Paul, is here connected with the term &quot;to have faith&quot;
(&quot;every believer&quot;). But this seems the only passage about Paul in
Acts where justification is mentioned. In Lucan fashion it is paralleled with
&quot;forgiveness of sins&quot; (a theme at <A href=PXW.html#GOSP.ACT.2.38><b>&#8658;</b></A> Acts
2:38; <A href=PXX.html#GOSP.ACT.3.19><b>&#8658;</b></A> 3:19;
<A href=PXZ.html#GOSP.ACT.5.31><b>&#8658;</b></A> 5:31; <A href=PY4.html#GOSP.ACT.10.43><b>&#8658;</b></A> 10:43) based
on Jesus' resurrection (<A href=PY7.html#GOSP.ACT.13.37><b>&#8658;</b></A> Acts 13:37) rather than
his cross, and is put negatively (<A href=PY7.html#GOSP.ACT.13.38><b>&#8658;</b></A> Acts 13:38).
Therefore, some would translate, &quot;in regard to everything from which you
could not be acquitted . . . every believer is acquitted.&quot;</p>

<p><sup></sup></p><br><br></font><font class="second_size_3"><b><a name=$42T href=#-42T>12</a></b></font><font class="verdana_size_1"><sup></sup> [46] The refusal to believe
frustrates God's plan for his chosen people; however, no adverse judgment is
made here concerning their ultimate destiny. Again, Luke, in the words of Paul,
speaks of the priority of Israel in the plan for salvation (see
<A href=PY4.html#GOSP.ACT.10.36><b>&#8658;</b></A> Acts 10:36).</p>
