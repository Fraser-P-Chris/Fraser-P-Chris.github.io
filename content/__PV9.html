<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><b><i>Matthew<br>
</i></b><b><i></i></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><b><i>Introduction</i></b></p>

<p>The position of
the Gospel according to Matthew as the first of the four gospels in the New
Testament reflects both the view that it was the first to be written, a view
that goes back to the late second century A.D., and the esteem in which it was
held by the church; no other was so frequently quoted in the noncanonical
literature of earliest Christianity. Although the majority of scholars now
reject the opinion about the time of its composition, the high estimation of
this work remains. The reason for that becomes clear upon study of the way in
which Matthew presents his story of Jesus, the demands of Christian
discipleship, and the breaking-in of the new and final age through the ministry
but particularly through the death and resurrection of Jesus.</p>

<p>The gospel begins with a
narrative prologue (<A href=__PVA.html#GOSP.MAT.1.1><b>&#8658;</b></A> Matthew
1:1-<A href=__PVB.html#GOSP.MAT.2.23><b>&#8658;</b></A> 2:23), the first part of which is a
genealogy of Jesus starting with Abraham, the father of Israel
(<A href=__PVA.html#GOSP.MAT.1.1><b>&#8658;</b></A> Matthew 1:1-17). Yet at the beginning of that
genealogy Jesus is designated as &quot;the son of David, the son of
Abraham&quot; (<A href=__PVA.html#GOSP.MAT.1.1><b>&#8658;</b></A> Matthew 1:1). The kingly ancestor
who lived about a thousand years after Abraham is named first, for this is the
genealogy of Jesus Christ, the Messiah, the royal anointed one
(<A href=__PVA.html#GOSP.MAT.1.16><b>&#8658;</b></A> Matthew 1:16). In the first of the episodes of
the infancy narrative that follow the genealogy, the mystery of Jesus' person
is declared. He is conceived of a virgin by the power of the Spirit of God
(<A href=__PVA.html#GOSP.MAT.1.18><b>&#8658;</b></A> Matthew 1:18-25). The first of the gospel's
fulfillment citations, whose purpose it is to show that he was the one to whom
the prophecies of Israel were pointing, occurs here (<A href=__PVA.html#GOSP.MAT.1.23><b>&#8658;</b></A> Matthew
1:23): he shall be named Emmanuel, for in him God is with us.</p>

<p>The announcement of the
birth of this newborn king of the Jews greatly troubles not only King Herod but
all Jerusalem (<A href=__PVB.html#GOSP.MAT.2.1><b>&#8658;</b></A> Matthew 2:1-3), yet the Gentile magi
are overjoyed to find him and offer him their homage and their gifts
(<A href=__PVB.html#GOSP.MAT.2.10><b>&#8658;</b></A> Matthew 2:10-11). Thus his ultimate rejection by
the mass of his own people and his acceptance by the Gentile nations is
foreshadowed. He must be taken to Egypt to escape the murderous plan of Herod.
By his sojourn there and his subsequent return after the king's death he
relives the Exodus experience of Israel. The words of the Lord spoken through
the prophet Hosea, &quot;Out of Egypt I called my son,&quot; are fulfilled in
him (<A href=__PVB.html#GOSP.MAT.2.15><b>&#8658;</b></A> Matthew 2:15); if Israel was God's son, Jesus
is so in a way far surpassing the dignity of that nation, as his marvelous
birth and the unfolding of his story show (see <A href=__PVC.html#GOSP.MAT.3.17><b>&#8658;</b></A> Matthew
3:17; <A href=__PVD.html#GOSP.MAT.4.1><b>&#8658;</b></A> 4:1-11;
<A href=__PVK.html#GOSP.MAT.11.27><b>&#8658;</b></A> 11:27; <A href=__PVN.html#GOSP.MAT.14.33><b>&#8658;</b></A> 14:33;
<A href=__PVP.html#GOSP.MAT.16.16><b>&#8658;</b></A> 16:16; <A href=__PW0.html#GOSP.MAT.27.54><b>&#8658;</b></A> 27:54). Back
in the land of Israel, he must be taken to Nazareth in Galilee because of the
danger to his life in Judea, where Herod's son Archelaus is now ruling
(<A href=__PVB.html#GOSP.MAT.2.22><b>&#8658;</b></A> Matthew 2:22-23). The sufferings of Jesus in the
infancy narrative anticipate those of his passion, and if his life is spared in
spite of the dangers, it is because his destiny is finally to give it on the
cross as &quot;a ransom for many&quot; (20, 28). Thus the word of the angel
will be fulfilled, &quot;. . . he will save his people from their sins&quot;
(<A href=__PVA.html#GOSP.MAT.1.21><b>&#8658;</b></A> Matthew 1:21; cf <A href=__PVZ.html#GOSP.MAT.26.28><b>&#8658;</b></A> Matthew
26:28).</p>

<p>In
<A href=__PVD.html#GOSP.MAT.4.12><b>&#8658;</b></A> Matthew 4:12 Matthew begins his account of the
ministry of Jesus, introducing it by the preparatory preaching of John the
Baptist (<A href=__PVC.html#GOSP.MAT.3.1><b>&#8658;</b></A> Matthew 3:1-12), the baptism of Jesus that
culminates in God's proclaiming him his &quot;beloved Son&quot;
(<A href=__PVC.html#GOSP.MAT.3.13><b>&#8658;</b></A> Matthew 3:13-17), and the temptation in which he
proves his true sonship by his victory over the devil's attempt to deflect him
from the way of obedience to the Father (<A href=__PVD.html#GOSP.MAT.4.1><b>&#8658;</b></A> Matthew
4:1-11). The central message of Jesus' preaching is the coming of the
kingdom of heaven and the need for repentance, a complete change of heart and
conduct, on the part of those who are to receive this great gift of God
(<A href=__PVD.html#GOSP.MAT.4.17><b>&#8658;</b></A> Matthew 4:17). Galilee is the setting for most of
his ministry; he leaves there for Judea only in <A href=__PVS.html#GOSP.MAT.19.1><b>&#8658;</b></A> Matthew
19:1, and his ministry in Jerusalem, the goal of his journey, is
limited to a few days (<A href=__PVU.html#GOSP.MAT.21.1><b>&#8658;</b></A> Matthew
21:1-<A href=__PVY.html#GOSP.MAT.25.46><b>&#8658;</b></A> 25:46).</p>

<p>In this extensive material
there are five great discourses of Jesus, each concluding with the formula
&quot;When Jesus finished these words&quot; or one closely similar
(<A href=__PVG.html#GOSP.MAT.7.28><b>&#8658;</b></A> Matthew 7:28; <A href=__PVK.html#GOSP.MAT.11.1><b>&#8658;</b></A> 11:1;
<A href=__PVM.html#GOSP.MAT.13.53><b>&#8658;</b></A> 13:53; <A href=__PVS.html#GOSP.MAT.19.1><b>&#8658;</b></A> 19:1;
<A href=__PVZ.html#GOSP.MAT.26.1><b>&#8658;</b></A> 26:1). These are an important structure of the
gospel. In every case the discourse is preceded by a narrative section, each
narrative and discourse together constituting a &quot;book&quot; of the gospel.
The discourses are, respectively, the &quot;Sermon on the Mount&quot;
(<A href=__PVE.html#GOSP.MAT.5.3><b>&#8658;</b></A> Matthew 5:3-<A href=__PVG.html#GOSP.MAT.7.27><b>&#8658;</b></A> 7:27),
the missionary discourse (<A href=__PVJ.html#GOSP.MAT.10.5><b>&#8658;</b></A> Matthew 10:5-42), the
parable discourse (<A href=__PVM.html#GOSP.MAT.13.3><b>&#8658;</b></A> Matthew 13:3-52), the
&quot;church order&quot; discourse (<A href=__PVR.html#GOSP.MAT.18.3><b>&#8658;</b></A> Matthew 18:3-35),
and the eschatological discourse (<A href=__PVX.html#GOSP.MAT.24.4><b>&#8658;</b></A> Matthew
24:4-<A href=__PVY.html#GOSP.MAT.25.46><b>&#8658;</b></A> 25:46). In large measure the
material of these discourses came to Matthew from his tradition, but his work
in modifying and adding to what he had received is abundantly evident. No other
evangelist gives the teaching of Jesus with such elegance and order as he.</p>

<p>In the &quot;Sermon on the
Mount&quot; the theme of righteousness is prominent, and even at this early
stage of the ministry the note of opposition is struck between Jesus and the
Pharisees, who are designated as &quot;the hypocrites&quot;
(<A href=__PVF.html#GOSP.MAT.6.2><b>&#8658;</b></A> Matthew 6:2, 5,
<A href=__PVF.html#GOSP.MAT.6.16><b>&#8658;</b></A> 16). The righteousness of his disciples must
surpass that of the scribes and Pharisees; otherwise, in spite of their alleged
following of Jesus, they will not enter into the kingdom of heaven
(<A href=__PVE.html#GOSP.MAT.5.20><b>&#8658;</b></A> Matthew 5:20). Righteousness means doing the will
of the heavenly Father (<A href=__PVG.html#GOSP.MAT.7.21><b>&#8658;</b></A> Matthew 7:21), and his
will is proclaimed in a manner that is startling to all who have identified it
with the law of Moses. The antitheses of the Sermon (<A href=__PVE.html#GOSP.MAT.5.21><b>&#8658;</b></A> Matthew
5:21-48) both accept (<A href=__PVE.html#GOSP.MAT.5.21><b>&#8658;</b></A> Matthew 5:21-30,
<A href=__PVE.html#GOSP.MAT.5.43><b>&#8658;</b></A> 43-48) and reject (<A href=__PVE.html#GOSP.MAT.5.31><b>&#8658;</b></A> Matthew
5:31-42) elements of that law, and in the former case the
understanding of the law's demands is deepened and extended. The antitheses are
the best commentary on the meaning of Jesus' claim that he has come not to
abolish but to fulfill the law (<A href=__PVE.html#GOSP.MAT.5.17><b>&#8658;</b></A> Matthew 5:17).
What is meant by fulfillment of the law is not the demand to keep it exactly as
it stood before the coming of Jesus, but rather his bringing the law to be a
lasting expression of the will of God, and in that fulfillment there is much
that will pass away. Should this appear contradictory to his saying that
&quot;until heaven and earth pass away&quot; not even the smallest part of the
law will pass (<A href=__PVE.html#GOSP.MAT.5.18><b>&#8658;</b></A> Matthew 5:18), that time of
fulfillment is not the dissolution of the universe but the coming of the new
age, which will occur with Jesus' death and resurrection. While righteousness
in the new age will continue to mean conduct that is in accordance with the
law, it will be conduct in accordance with the law as expounded and interpreted
by Jesus (cf <A href=__PW1.html#GOSP.MAT.28.20><b>&#8658;</b></A> Matthew 28:20, &quot;. . . all that
I have commanded you&quot;).</p>

<p>Though Jesus speaks harshly
about the Pharisees in the Sermon, his judgment is not solely a condemnation of
them. The Pharisees are portrayed as a negative example for his disciples, and
his condemnation of those who claim to belong to him while disobeying his word
is no less severe (<A href=__PVG.html#GOSP.MAT.7.21><b>&#8658;</b></A> Matthew 7:21-23,
<A href=__PVG.html#GOSP.MAT.7.26><b>&#8658;</b></A> 26-27).</p>

<p>In
<A href=__PVD.html#GOSP.MAT.4.23><b>&#8658;</b></A> Matthew 4:23 a summary statement of Jesus'
activity speaks not only of his teaching and proclaiming the gospel but of his
&quot;curing every disease and illness among the people&quot;; this is repeated
almost verbatim in <A href=__PVI.html#GOSP.MAT.9.35><b>&#8658;</b></A> Matthew 9:35. The narrative
section that follows the Sermon on the Mount (<A href=__PVH.html#GOSP.MAT.8.1><b>&#8658;</b></A> Matthew
8:1-<A href=__PVI.html#GOSP.MAT.9.38><b>&#8658;</b></A> 9:38) is composed principally of accounts
of those merciful deeds of Jesus, but it is far from being simply a collection
of stories about miraculous cures. The nature of the community that Jesus will
establish is shown; it will always be under the protection of him whose power
can deal with all dangers (<A href=__PVH.html#GOSP.MAT.8.23><b>&#8658;</b></A> Matthew 8:23-27), but
it is only for those who are prepared to follow him at whatever cost
(<A href=__PVH.html#GOSP.MAT.8.16><b>&#8658;</b></A> Matthew 8:16-22), not only believing Israelites
but Gentiles who have come to faith in him (<A href=__PVH.html#GOSP.MAT.8.10><b>&#8658;</b></A> Matthew
8:10-12). The disciples begin to have some insight, however
imperfect, into the mystery of Jesus' person. They wonder about him whom
&quot;the winds and the sea obey&quot; (<A href=__PVH.html#GOSP.MAT.8.27><b>&#8658;</b></A> Matthew
8:27), and they witness his bold declaration of the forgiveness of
the paralytic's sins (<A href=__PVI.html#GOSP.MAT.9.2><b>&#8658;</b></A> Matthew 9:2). That episode of
the narrative moves on two levels. When the crowd sees the cure that testifies
to the authority of Jesus, the Son of Man, to forgive sins
(<A href=__PVI.html#GOSP.MAT.9.6><b>&#8658;</b></A> Matthew 9:6), they glorify God &quot;who had given
such authority to human beings&quot; (<A href=__PVI.html#GOSP.MAT.9.8><b>&#8658;</b></A> Matthew 9:8).
The forgiveness of sins is now not the prerogative of Jesus alone but of
&quot;human beings,&quot; that is, of the disciples who constitute the
community of Jesus, the church. The ecclesial character of this narrative
section could hardly be more plainly indicated.</p>

<p>The end of the section
prepares for the discourse on the church's mission (<A href=__PVJ.html#GOSP.MAT.10.5><b>&#8658;</b></A> Matthew
10:5-42). Jesus is moved to pity at the sight of the crowds who are
like sheep without a shepherd (<A href=__PVI.html#GOSP.MAT.9.36><b>&#8658;</b></A> Matthew 9:36), and
he sends out the twelve disciples to make the proclamation with which his own
ministry began, &quot;The kingdom of heaven is at hand&quot;
(<A href=__PVJ.html#GOSP.MAT.10.7><b>&#8658;</b></A> Matthew 10:7; cf <A href=__PVD.html#GOSP.MAT.4.17><b>&#8658;</b></A> Matthew
4:17), and to drive out demons and cure the sick as he has done
(<A href=__PVJ.html#GOSP.MAT.10.1><b>&#8658;</b></A> Matthew 10:1). Their mission is limited to Israel
(<A href=__PVJ.html#GOSP.MAT.10.5><b>&#8658;</b></A> Matthew 10:5-6) as Jesus' own was
(<A href=__PVO.html#GOSP.MAT.15.24><b>&#8658;</b></A> Matthew 15:24), yet in
<A href=__PVO.html#GOSP.MAT.15.16><b>&#8658;</b></A> Matthew 15:16 that perspective broadens and the
discourse begins to speak of the mission that the disciples will have after the
resurrection and of the severe persecution that will attend it
(<A href=__PVJ.html#GOSP.MAT.10.18><b>&#8658;</b></A> Matthew 10:18). Again, the discourse moves on
two levels: that of the time of Jesus and that of the time of the church.</p>

<p>The narrative section of
the third book (<A href=__PVK.html#GOSP.MAT.11.2><b>&#8658;</b></A> Matthew
11:2-<A href=__PVL.html#GOSP.MAT.12.50><b>&#8658;</b></A> 12:50) deals with the growing
opposition to Jesus. Hostility toward him has already beenmanifested
(<A href=__PVH.html#GOSP.MAT.8.10><b>&#8658;</b></A> Matthew 8:10; <A href=__PVI.html#GOSP.MAT.9.3><b>&#8658;</b></A> 9:3,
<A href=__PVI.html#GOSP.MAT.9.10><b>&#8658;</b></A> 10-13, <A href=__PVI.html#GOSP.MAT.9.34><b>&#8658;</b></A> 34), but here
it becomes more intense. The rejection of Jesus comes, as before, from
Pharisees, who take &quot;counsel against him to put him to death&quot;
(<A href=__PVL.html#GOSP.MAT.12.14><b>&#8658;</b></A> Matthew 12:14) and repeat their earlier
accusation that he drives out demons because he is in league with demonic power
(<A href=__PVL.html#GOSP.MAT.12.22><b>&#8658;</b></A> Matthew 12:22-24). But they are not alone in
their rejection. Jesus complains of the lack of faith of &quot;this
generation&quot; of Israelites (<A href=__PVK.html#GOSP.MAT.11.16><b>&#8658;</b></A> Matthew 11:16-19)
and reproaches the towns &quot;where most of his mighty deeds had been
done&quot; for not heeding his call to repentance (<A href=__PVK.html#GOSP.MAT.11.20><b>&#8658;</b></A> Matthew
11:20-24). This dark picture is relieved by Jesus' praise of the
Father who has enabled &quot;the childlike&quot; to accept him
(<A href=__PVK.html#GOSP.MAT.11.25><b>&#8658;</b></A> Matthew 11:25-27), but on the whole the story is
one of opposition to his word and blindness to the meaning of his deeds. The
whole section ends with his declaring that not even the most intimate blood
relationship with him counts for anything; his only true relatives are those
who do the will of his heavenly Father (<A href=__PVL.html#GOSP.MAT.12.48><b>&#8658;</b></A> Matthew
12:48-50).</p>

<p>The narrative of rejection
leads up to the parable discourse (<A href=__PVM.html#GOSP.MAT.13.3><b>&#8658;</b></A> Matthew
13:3-52). The reason given for Jesus' speaking to the crowds in
parables is that they have hardened themselves against his clear teaching,
unlike the disciples to whom knowledge of &quot;the mysteries of the kingdom
has been granted&quot; (<A href=__PVM.html#GOSP.MAT.13.10><b>&#8658;</b></A> Matthew 13:10-16). In
<A href=__PVM.html#GOSP.MAT.13.36><b>&#8658;</b></A> Matthew 13:36 he dismisses the crowds and
continues the discourse to his disciples alone, who claim, at the end, to have
understood all that he has said (<A href=__PVM.html#GOSP.MAT.13.51><b>&#8658;</b></A> Matthew 13:51).
But, lest the impression be given that the church of Jesus is made up only of
true disciples, the explanation of the parable of the weeds among the wheat
(<A href=__PVM.html#GOSP.MAT.13.37><b>&#8658;</b></A> Matthew 13:37-43), as well as the parable of the
net thrown into the sea &quot;which collects fish of every kind&quot;
(<A href=__PVM.html#GOSP.MAT.13.47><b>&#8658;</b></A> Matthew 13:47-49), shows that it is composed of
both the righteous and the wicked, and that separation between the two will be
made only at the time of the final judgment.</p>

<p>In the narrative that
constitutes the first part of the fourth book of the gospel
(<A href=__PVM.html#GOSP.MAT.13.54><b>&#8658;</b></A> Matthew
13:54-<A href=__PVQ.html#GOSP.MAT.17.27><b>&#8658;</b></A> 17:27), Jesus is shown preparing
for the establishment of his church with its teaching authority that will
supplant the blind guidance of the Pharisees (<A href=__PVO.html#GOSP.MAT.15.13><b>&#8658;</b></A> Matthew
15:13-14), whose teaching, curiously said to be that of the Sadducees
also, is repudiated by Jesus as the norm for his disciples
(<A href=__PVP.html#GOSP.MAT.16.6><b>&#8658;</b></A> Matthew 16:6,
<A href=__PVP.html#GOSP.MAT.16.11><b>&#8658;</b></A> 11-12). The church of Jesus will be built on
Peter (<A href=__PVP.html#GOSP.MAT.16.18><b>&#8658;</b></A> Matthew 16:18), who will be given
authority to bind and loose on earth, an authority whose exercise will be
confirmed in heaven (<A href=__PVP.html#GOSP.MAT.16.19><b>&#8658;</b></A> Matthew 16:19). The metaphor
of binding and loosing has a variety of meanings, among them that of giving
authoritative teaching. This promise is made to Peter directly after he has
confessed Jesus to be the Messiah, the Son of the living God
(<A href=__PVP.html#GOSP.MAT.16.16><b>&#8658;</b></A> Matthew 16:16), a confession that he has made as
the result of revelation given to him by the heavenly Father
(<A href=__PVP.html#GOSP.MAT.16.17><b>&#8658;</b></A> Matthew 16:17); Matthew's ecclesiology is based
on his high christology.</p>

<p>Directly after that
confession Jesus begins to instruct his disciples about how he must go the way
of suffering and death (<A href=__PVP.html#GOSP.MAT.16.21><b>&#8658;</b></A> Matthew 16:21). Peter,
who has been praised for his confession, protests against this and receives
from Jesus the sharpest of rebukes for attempting to deflect Jesus from his
God-appointed destiny. The future rock upon whom the church will be built is
still a man of &quot;little faith&quot; (see <A href=__PVN.html#GOSP.MAT.14.31><b>&#8658;</b></A> Matthew
14:31). Both he and the other disciples must know not only that Jesus
will have to suffer and die but that they too will have to follow him on the
way of the cross if they are truly to be his disciples
(<A href=__PVP.html#GOSP.MAT.16.24><b>&#8658;</b></A> Matthew 16:24-25).</p>

<p>The discourse following
this narrative (<A href=__PVR.html#GOSP.MAT.18.1><b>&#8658;</b></A> Matthew 18:1-35) is often called
the &quot;church order&quot; discourse, although that title is perhaps
misleading since the emphasis is not on the structure of the church but on the
care that the disciples must have for one another in respect to guarding each
other's faith in Jesus (<A href=__PVR.html#GOSP.MAT.18.6><b>&#8658;</b></A> Matthew 18:6-7), to
seeking out those who have wandered from the fold (<A href=__PVR.html#GOSP.MAT.18.10><b>&#8658;</b></A> Matthew
18:10-14), and to repeated forgiving of their fellow disciples who
have offended them (<A href=__PVR.html#GOSP.MAT.18.21><b>&#8658;</b></A> Matthew 18:21-35). But there
is also the obligation to correct the sinful fellow Christian and, should one
refuse to be corrected, separation from the community is demanded
(<A href=__PVR.html#GOSP.MAT.18.15><b>&#8658;</b></A> Matthew 18:15-18).</p>

<p>The narrative of the fifth
book (<A href=__PVS.html#GOSP.MAT.19.1><b>&#8658;</b></A> Matthew
19:1-<A href=__PVW.html#GOSP.MAT.23.39><b>&#8658;</b></A> 23:39) begins with the departure
of Jesus and his disciples from Galilee for Jerusalem. In the course of their
journey Jesus for the third time predicts the passion that awaits him at
Jerusalem and also his resurrection (<A href=__PVT.html#GOSP.MAT.20.17><b>&#8658;</b></A> Matthew
20:17-19). At his entrance into the city he is hailed as the Son of David
by the crowds accompanying him (<A href=__PVU.html#GOSP.MAT.21.9><b>&#8658;</b></A> Matthew 21:9). He
cleanses the temple (<A href=__PVU.html#GOSP.MAT.21.12><b>&#8658;</b></A> Matthew 21:12-17), and in
the few days of his Jerusalem ministry he engages in a series of controversies
with the Jewish religious leaders (<A href=__PVU.html#GOSP.MAT.21.23><b>&#8658;</b></A> Matthew
21:23-27; <A href=__PVV.html#GOSP.MAT.22.15><b>&#8658;</b></A> 22:15-22,
<A href=__PVV.html#GOSP.MAT.22.23><b>&#8658;</b></A> 23-33, <A href=__PVV.html#GOSP.MAT.22.34><b>&#8658;</b></A> 34-40,
<A href=__PVV.html#GOSP.MAT.22.41><b>&#8658;</b></A> 41-46), meanwhile speaking parables against them
(<A href=__PVU.html#GOSP.MAT.21.28><b>&#8658;</b></A> Matthew 21:28-32,
<A href=__PVU.html#GOSP.MAT.21.33><b>&#8658;</b></A> 33-46), against all those Israelites who have
rejected God's invitation to the messianic banquet (<A href=__PVV.html#GOSP.MAT.22.1><b>&#8658;</b></A> Matthew
22:1-10), and against all, Jew and Gentile, who have accepted but
have shown themselves unworthy of it (<A href=__PVV.html#GOSP.MAT.22.11><b>&#8658;</b></A> Matthew
22:11-14). Once again, the perspective of the evangelist includes not
only the time of Jesus' ministry but that of the preaching of the gospel after
his resurrection. The narrative culminates in Jesus' denunciation of the
scribes and Pharisees, reflecting not only his own opposition to them but that
of Matthew's church (<A href=__PVW.html#GOSP.MAT.23.1><b>&#8658;</b></A> Matthew 23:1-36), and in
Jesus' lament over Jerusalem (<A href=__PVW.html#GOSP.MAT.23.37><b>&#8658;</b></A> Matthew 23:37-39).</p>

<p>In the discourse of the
fifth book (<A href=__PVX.html#GOSP.MAT.24.1><b>&#8658;</b></A> Matthew
24:1-<A href=__PVY.html#GOSP.MAT.25.46><b>&#8658;</b></A> 25:46), the last of the great
structural discoursesof the gospel, Jesus predicts the destruction of the
temple and his own final coming. The time of the latter is unknown
(<A href=__PVX.html#GOSP.MAT.24.36><b>&#8658;</b></A> Matthew 24:36,
<A href=__PVX.html#GOSP.MAT.24.44><b>&#8658;</b></A> 44), and the disciples are exhorted in various
parables to live in readiness for it, a readiness that entails faithful
attention to the duties of the interim period (<A href=__PVX.html#GOSP.MAT.24.45><b>&#8658;</b></A> Matthew
24:45-<A href=__PVY.html#GOSP.MAT.25.30><b>&#8658;</b></A> 25:30). The coming of Jesus will
bring with it the great judgment by which the everlasting destiny of all will
be determined (<A href=__PVY.html#GOSP.MAT.25.31><b>&#8658;</b></A> Matthew 25:31-46).</p>

<p>The story of Jesus' passion
and resurrection (<A href=__PVZ.html#GOSP.MAT.26.1><b>&#8658;</b></A> Matthew
26:1-<A href=__PW1.html#GOSP.MAT.28.20><b>&#8658;</b></A> 28:20), the climax of the gospel,
throws light on all that has preceded. In Matthew &quot;righteousness&quot;
means both the faithful response to the will of God demanded of all to whom
that will is announced and also the saving activity of God for his people (see
<A href=__PVC.html#GOSP.MAT.3.15><b>&#8658;</b></A> Matthew 3:15; <A href=__PVE.html#GOSP.MAT.5.6><b>&#8658;</b></A> 5:6;
<A href=__PVF.html#GOSP.MAT.6.33><b>&#8658;</b></A> 6:33). The passion supremely exemplifies both
meanings of that central Matthean word. In Jesus' absolute faithfulness to the
Father's will that he drink the cup of suffering (<A href=__PVZ.html#GOSP.MAT.26.39><b>&#8658;</b></A> Matthew
26:39), the incomparable model for Christian obedience is given; in
his death &quot;for the forgiveness of sins&quot; (<A href=__PVZ.html#GOSP.MAT.26.28><b>&#8658;</b></A> Matthew
26:28), the saving power of God is manifested as never before.</p>

<p>Matthew's portrayal of
Jesus in his passion combines both themajestic serenity of the obedient Son who
goes his destined way in fulfillment of the scriptures
(<A href=__PVZ.html#GOSP.MAT.26.52><b>&#8658;</b></A> Matthew 26:52-54), confident of his ultimate
vindication by God, and the depths of fear and abandonment that he feels in
face of death (<A href=__PVZ.html#GOSP.MAT.26.38><b>&#8658;</b></A> Matthew 26:38-39;
<A href=__PW0.html#GOSP.MAT.27.46><b>&#8658;</b></A> 27:46). These two aspects are expressed by an Old
Testament theme that occurs often in the narrative, i.e., the portrait of the
suffering Righteous One who complains to God in his misery, but is certain of
eventual deliverance from his terrible ordeal.</p>

<p>The passion-resurrection of
God's Son means nothing less than the turn of the ages, a new stage of history,
the coming of the Son of Man in his kingdom (<A href=__PW1.html#GOSP.MAT.28.18><b>&#8658;</b></A> Matthew
28:18; cf <A href=__PVP.html#GOSP.MAT.16.28><b>&#8658;</b></A> Matthew 16:28). That is the
sense of the apocalyptic signs that accompany Jesus' death
(<A href=__PW0.html#GOSP.MAT.27.51><b>&#8658;</b></A> Matthew 27:51-53) and resurrection
(<A href=__PW1.html#GOSP.MAT.28.2><b>&#8658;</b></A> Matthew 28:2). Although the old age continues, as
it will until the manifestation of Jesus' triumph at his parousia, the final
age has now begun. This is known only to those who have seen the Risen One and
to those, both Jews and Gentiles, who have believed in their announcement of Jesus'
triumph and have themselves become his disciples (cf
<A href=__PW1.html#GOSP.MAT.28.19><b>&#8658;</b></A> Matthew 28:19). To them he is constantly, though
invisibly, present (<A href=__PW1.html#GOSP.MAT.28.20><b>&#8658;</b></A> Matthew 28:20), verifying the
name Emmanuel, &quot;God is with us&quot; (cf <A href=__PVA.html#GOSP.MAT.1.23><b>&#8658;</b></A> Matthew
1:23).</p>

<p>The questions of
authorship, sources, and the time of composition of this gospel have received
many answers, none of which can claim more than a greater or lesser degree of
probability. The one now favored by the majority of scholars is the following.</p>

<p>The ancient tradition that
the author was the disciple and apostle of Jesus named Matthew (see
<A href=__PVJ.html#GOSP.MAT.10.3><b>&#8658;</b></A> Matthew 10:3) is untenable because the gospel is
based, in large part, on the Gospel according to Mark (almost all the verses of
that gospel have been utilized in this), and it is hardly likely that a
companion of Jesus would have followed so extensively an account that came from
one who admittedly never had such an association rather than rely on his own
memories. The attribution of the gospel to the disciple Matthew may have been
due to his having been responsible for some of the traditions found in it, but
that is far from certain.</p>

<p>The unknown author, whom we
shall continue to call Matthew for the sake of convenience, drew not only upon
the Gospel according to Mark but upon a large body of material (principally,
sayings of Jesus) not found in Mark that corresponds, sometimes exactly, to
material found also in the Gospel according to Luke. This material, called
&quot;Q&quot; (probably from the first letter of the German word Quelle,
meaning &quot;source&quot;), represents traditions, written and oral, used by
both Matthew and Luke. Mark and Q are sources common to the two other synoptic
gospels; hence the name the &quot;Two-Source Theory&quot; given to this
explanation of the relation among the synoptics.</p>

<p>In addition to what Matthew
drew from Mark and Q, his gospel contains material that is found only there.
This is often designated &quot;M,&quot; written or oral tradition that was
available to the author. Since Mark was written shortly before or shortly after
A.D. 70 (see Introduction to Mark), Matthew was composed certainly after that
date, which marks the fall of Jerusalem to the Romans at the time of the First
Jewish Revolt (A.D. 66-70), and probably at least a decade later since
Matthew's use of Mark presupposes a wide diffusion of that gospel. The post -
A.D. 70 date is confirmed within the text by <A href=__PVV.html#GOSP.MAT.22.7><b>&#8658;</b></A> Matthew
22:7, which refers to the destruction of Jerusalem.</p>

<p>As for the place where the
gospel was composed, a plausible suggestion is that it was Antioch, the capital
of the Roman province of Syria. That large and important city had a mixed
population of Greek-speaking Gentiles and Jews. The tensions between Jewish and
Gentile Christians there in the time of Paul (see <A href=__P102.html#NTLET.GAL.2.1><b>&#8658;</b></A> Gal
2:1-14) in respect to Christian obligation to observe Mosaic law are
partially similar to tensions that can be seen between the two groups in
Matthew's gospel. The church of Matthew, originally strongly Jewish Christian,
had become one in which Gentile Christians were predominant. His gospel answers
the question how obedience to the will of God is to be expressed by those who
live after the &quot;turn of the ages,&quot; the death and resurrection of
Jesus.</p>

<p>The principal divisions of
the Gospel according to Matthew are the following:</p>
