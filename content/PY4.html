<p class="MsoNormal main_text_block"><sup><font class="verdana_size_2"><sup><a name=-41M href=#$41M>1</a></sup></font></sup> Now in Caesarea there was a man named
Cornelius, a centurion of the Cohort called the Italica, <sup><font class="verdana_size_2"><sup><a name=-41N href=#$41N>2</a></sup></font></sup> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2
</p>

<p class="MsoNormal main_text_block">devout and God-fearing along with his whole household,
who used to give alms generously <sup><font class="verdana_size_2"><sup><a name=-41O href=#$41O>3</a></sup></font></sup> to the Jewish people and
pray to God constantly. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>3
</p>

<p class="MsoNormal main_text_block">One afternoon about three o'clock, <sup><font class="verdana_size_2"><sup><a name=-41P href=#$41P>4</a></sup></font></sup>
he saw plainly in a vision an angel of God come in to him and say to him,
&quot;Cornelius.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>4
</p>

<p class="MsoNormal main_text_block">He looked intently at him and, seized with
fear, said, &quot;What is it, sir?&quot; He said to him, &quot;Your prayers and
almsgiving have ascended as a memorial offering before God. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>5
</p>

<p class="MsoNormal main_text_block">Now send some men to Joppa and summon one Simon
who is called Peter. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>6
</p>

<p class="MsoNormal main_text_block">He is staying with another Simon, a tanner, who
has a house by the sea.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>7
</p>

<p class="MsoNormal main_text_block">When the angel who spoke to him had left, he
called two of his servants and a devout soldier <sup><font class="verdana_size_2"><sup><a name=-41Q href=#$41Q>5</a></sup></font></sup> from his
staff, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>8
</p>

<p class="MsoNormal main_text_block">explained everything to them, and sent them to
Joppa. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>9
</p>

<p class="MsoNormal main_text_block"><sup><font class="verdana_size_2"><sup><a name=-41R href=#$41R>6</a></sup></font></sup> The next day, while they were on their way and
nearing the city, Peter went up to the roof terrace to pray at about noontime. <sup><font class="verdana_size_2"><sup><a name=-41S href=#$41S>7</a></sup></font></sup>
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>10
</p>

<p class="MsoNormal main_text_block">He was hungry and wished to eat, and while they
were making preparations he fell into a trance. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>11
</p>

<p class="MsoNormal main_text_block">He saw heaven opened and something resembling a
large sheet coming down, lowered to the ground by its four corners. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>12
</p>

<p class="MsoNormal main_text_block">In it were all the earth's four-legged animals
and reptiles and the birds of the sky. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>13
</p>

<p class="MsoNormal main_text_block">A voice said to him, &quot;Get up, Peter.
Slaughter and eat.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>14
</p>

<p class="MsoNormal main_text_block">But Peter said, &quot;Certainly not, sir. For
never have I eaten anything profane and unclean.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>15
</p>

<p class="MsoNormal main_text_block">The voice spoke to him again, a second time,
&quot;What God has made clean, you are not to call profane.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>16
</p>

<p class="MsoNormal main_text_block">This happened three times, and then the object
was taken up into the sky. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>17
</p>

<p class="MsoNormal main_text_block"><sup><font class="verdana_size_2"><sup><a name=-41T href=#$41T>8</a></sup></font></sup> While Peter was in doubt about the meaning of
the vision he had seen, the men sent by Cornelius asked for Simon's house and
arrived at the entrance. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>18
</p>

<p class="MsoNormal main_text_block">They called out inquiring whether Simon, who is
called Peter, was staying there. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>19
</p>

<p class="MsoNormal main_text_block">As Peter was pondering the vision, the Spirit
said (to him), &quot;There are three men here looking for you. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>20
</p>

<p class="MsoNormal main_text_block">So get up, go downstairs, and accompany them
without hesitation, because I have sent them.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>21
</p>

<p class="MsoNormal main_text_block">Then Peter went down to the men and said,
&quot;I am the one you are looking for. What is the reason for your being
here?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>22
</p>

<p class="MsoNormal main_text_block">They answered, &quot;Cornelius, a centurion, an
upright and God-fearing man, respected by the whole Jewish nation, was directed
by a holy angel to summon you to his house and to hear what you have to
say.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>23
</p>

<p class="MsoNormal main_text_block">So he invited them in and showed them
hospitality. The next day he got up and went with them, and some of the brothers
from Joppa went with him. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>24
</p>

<p class="MsoNormal main_text_block"><sup><font class="verdana_size_2"><sup><a name=-41U href=#$41U>9</a></sup></font></sup> On the following day he entered Caesarea.
Cornelius was expecting them and had called together his relatives and close
friends. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>25
</p>

<p class="MsoNormal main_text_block">When Peter entered, Cornelius met him and, falling
at his feet, paid him homage. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>26
</p>

<p class="MsoNormal main_text_block">Peter, however, raised him up, saying,
&quot;Get up. I myself am also a human being.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>27
</p>

<p class="MsoNormal main_text_block">While he conversed with him, he went in and
found many people gathered together </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>28
</p>

<p class="MsoNormal main_text_block">and said to them, &quot;You know that it is
unlawful for a Jewish man to associate with, or visit, a Gentile, but God has
shown me that I should not call any person profane or unclean. <sup><font class="verdana_size_2"><sup><a name=-41V href=#$41V>10</a></sup></font></sup>
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>29
</p>

<p class="MsoNormal main_text_block">And that is why I came without objection when
sent for. May I ask, then, why you summoned me?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>30
</p>

<p class="MsoNormal main_text_block">Cornelius replied, &quot;Four days ago <sup><font class="verdana_size_2"><sup><a name=-41W href=#$41W>11</a></sup></font></sup>
at this hour, three o'clock in the afternoon, I was at prayer in my house when
suddenly a man in dazzling robes stood before me and said, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>31
</p>

<p class="MsoNormal main_text_block">'Cornelius, your prayer has been heard and your
almsgiving remembered before God. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>32
</p>

<p class="MsoNormal main_text_block">Send therefore to Joppa and summon Simon, who
is called Peter. He is a guest in the house of Simon, a tanner, by the sea.' </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>33
</p>

<p class="MsoNormal main_text_block">So I sent for you immediately, and you were
kind enough to come. Now therefore we are all here in the presence of God to
listen to all that you have been commanded by the Lord.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>34
</p>

<p class="MsoNormal main_text_block"><sup><font class="verdana_size_2"><sup><a name=-41X href=#$41X>12</a></sup></font></sup> Then Peter proceeded to speak and said, <sup><font class="verdana_size_2"><sup><a name=-41Y href=#$41Y>13</a></sup></font></sup>
&quot;In truth, I see that God shows no partiality. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>35
</p>

<p class="MsoNormal main_text_block">Rather, in every nation whoever fears him and
acts uprightly is acceptable to him. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>36

he sent to the Israelites as he proclaimed peace through Jesus Christ, who is
Lord of all, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>37
</p>

<p class="MsoNormal main_text_block">what has happened all over Judea, beginning in
Galilee after the baptism that John preached, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>38
</p>

<p class="MsoNormal main_text_block">how God anointed Jesus of Nazareth <sup><font class="verdana_size_2"><sup><a name=-421 href=#$421>16</a></sup></font></sup>
with the holy Spirit and power. He went about doing good and healing all those
oppressed by the devil, for God was with him. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>39
</p>

<p class="MsoNormal main_text_block">We are witnesses <sup><font class="verdana_size_2"><sup><a name=-422 href=#$422>17</a></sup></font></sup> of all
that he did both in the country of the Jews and (in) Jerusalem. They put him to
death by hanging him on a tree. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>40
</p>

<p class="MsoNormal main_text_block">This man God raised (on) the third day and
granted that he be visible, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>41
</p>

<p class="MsoNormal main_text_block">not to all the people, but to us, the witnesses
chosen by God in advance, who ate and drank with him after he rose from the
dead. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>42
</p>

<p class="MsoNormal main_text_block">He commissioned us to preach to the people and
testify that he is the one appointed by God as judge of the living and the
dead. <sup><font class="verdana_size_2"><sup><a name=-423 href=#$423>18</a></sup></font></sup> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>43

<p class="MsoNormal main_text_block">To him all the prophets bear witness, that
everyone who believes in him will receive forgiveness of sins through his
name.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>44
</p>

<p class="MsoNormal main_text_block">While Peter was still speaking these things,
the holy Spirit fell upon all who were listening to the word. <sup><font class="verdana_size_2"><sup><a name=-424 href=#$424>19</a></sup></font></sup>
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>45
</p>

<p class="MsoNormal main_text_block">The circumcised believers who had accompanied
Peter were astounded that the gift of the holy Spirit should have been poured
out on the Gentiles also, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>46
</p>

<p class="MsoNormal main_text_block">for they could hear them speaking in tongues
and glorifying God. Then Peter responded, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>47
</p>

<p class="MsoNormal main_text_block">&quot;Can anyone withhold the water for
baptizing these people, who have received the holy Spirit even as we
have?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>48
</p>

<p class="MsoNormal main_text_block">He ordered them to be baptized in the name of
Jesus Christ. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>49
</p>

<p class="MsoNormal main_text_block">Then they invited him to stay for a few days. </p>

<p><sup></sup></p><br><br></font><font class="second_size_3"><b><a name=$41Q href=#-41Q>5</a></b></font><font class="verdana_size_1"><sup></sup> [7] A devout soldier: by using this
adjective, Luke probably intends to classify him as a &quot;God-fearer&quot;
(see the note on <A href=PY2.html#GOSP.ACT.8.26><b>&#8658;</b></A> Acts 8:26-40).</p>

<p><sup></sup></p><br><br></font><font class="second_size_3"><b><a name=$41R href=#-41R>6</a></b></font><font class="verdana_size_1"><sup></sup> [9-16] The vision is intended to
prepare Peter to share the food of Cornelius' household without qualms of
conscience (<A href=PY4.html#GOSP.ACT.10.48><b>&#8658;</b></A> Acts 10:48). The necessity of such
instructions to Peter reveals that at first not even the apostles fully grasped
the implications of Jesus' teaching on the law. In Acts, the initial insight
belongs to Stephen.</p>

<p><sup></sup></p><br><br></font><font class="second_size_3"><b><a name=$41S href=#-41S>7</a></b></font><font class="verdana_size_1"><sup></sup> [9] At about noontime: literally,
&quot;about the sixth hour.&quot;</p>

<p><sup></sup></p><br><br></font><font class="second_size_3"><b><a name=$41T href=#-41T>8</a></b></font><font class="verdana_size_1"><sup></sup> [17-23] The arrival of the Gentile
emissaries with their account of the angelic apparition illuminates Peter's
vision: he is to be prepared to admit Gentiles, who were considered unclean
like the animals of his vision, into the Christian community.</p>

<p><sup></sup></p><br><br></font><font class="second_size_3"><b><a name=$41U href=#-41U>9</a></b></font><font class="verdana_size_1"><sup></sup> [24-27] So impressed is Cornelius
with the apparition that he invites close personal friends to join him in his
meeting with Peter. But his understanding of the person he is about to meet is
not devoid of superstition, suggested by his falling down before him. For a
similar experience of Paul and Barnabas, see <A href=PY8.html#GOSP.ACT.14.11><b>&#8658;</b></A> Acts
14:11-18.</p>

<p><sup></sup></p><br><br></font><font class="second_size_3"><b><a name=$41V href=#-41V>10</a></b></font><font class="verdana_size_1"><sup></sup> [28] Peter now fully understands
the meaning of his vision; see the note on <A href=PY4.html#GOSP.ACT.10.17><b>&#8658;</b></A> Acts
10:17-23.</p>

<p><sup></sup></p><br><br></font><font class="second_size_3"><b><a name=$41W href=#-41W>11</a></b></font><font class="verdana_size_1"><sup></sup> [30] Four days ago: literally,
&quot;from the fourth day up to this hour.&quot;</p>

<p><sup></sup></p><br><br></font><font class="second_size_3"><b><a name=$41X href=#-41X>12</a></b></font><font class="verdana_size_1"><sup></sup> [34-43] Peter's speech to the
household of Cornelius typifies early Christian preaching to Gentiles.</p>

<p><sup></sup></p><br><br></font><font class="second_size_3"><b><a name=$41Y href=#-41Y>13</a></b></font><font class="verdana_size_1"><sup></sup> [34-35] The revelation of God's
choice of Israel to be the people of God did not mean he withheld the divine
favor from other people.</p>

<p><sup></sup></p><br><br></font><font class="second_size_3"><b><a name=$41Z href=#-41Z>14</a></b></font><font class="verdana_size_1"><sup></sup> [36-43] These words are more
directed to Luke's Christian readers than to the household of Cornelius, as
indicated by the opening words, &quot;You know.&quot; They trace the continuity
between the preaching and teaching of Jesus of Nazareth and the proclamation of
Jesus by the early community. The emphasis on this divinely ordained continuity
(<A href=PY4.html#GOSP.ACT.10.41><b>&#8658;</b></A> Acts 10:41) is meant to assure Luke's readers of
the fidelity of Christian tradition to the words and deeds of Jesus.</p>

<p><sup></sup></p><br><br></font><font class="second_size_3"><b><a name=$420 href=#-420>15</a></b></font><font class="verdana_size_1"><sup></sup> [36] To the Israelites: Luke, in
the words of Peter, speaks of the prominent position occupied by Israel in the
history of salvation.</p>

<p><sup></sup></p><br><br></font><font class="second_size_3"><b><a name=$421 href=#-421>16</a></b></font><font class="verdana_size_1"><sup></sup> [38] Jesus of Nazareth: God's
revelation of his plan for the destinyof humanity through Israel culminated in
Jesus of Nazareth. Consequently, the ministry of Jesus is an integral part of
God's revelation. This viewpoint explains why the early Christian communities
were interested in conserving the historical substance of the ministry of
Jesus, a tradition leading to the production of the four gospels.</p>

<p><sup></sup></p><br><br></font><font class="second_size_3"><b><a name=$422 href=#-422>17</a></b></font><font class="verdana_size_1"><sup></sup> [39] We are witnesses: the apostolic
testimony was not restricted to the resurrection of Jesus but also included his
historical ministry. This witness, however, was theological in character; the
Twelve, divinely mandated as prophets, were empowered to interpret his sayings
and deeds in the light of his redemptive death and resurrection. The meaning of
these words and deeds was to be made clear to the developing Christian
community as the bearer of the word of salvation (cf <A href=PXV.html#GOSP.ACT.1.21><b>&#8658;</b></A> Acts
1:21-26). Hanging him on a tree: see the note on
<A href=PXZ.html#GOSP.ACT.5.30><b>&#8658;</b></A> 5:30.</p>

<p><sup></sup></p><br><br></font><font class="second_size_3"><b><a name=$423 href=#-423>18</a></b></font><font class="verdana_size_1"><sup></sup> [42] As judge of the living and the
dead: the apostolic preaching to the Jews appealed to their messianic hope,
while the preaching to Gentiles stressed the coming divine judgment; cf <A href=P10P.html#NTLET.1THE.1.10><b>&#8658;</b></A> 1
Thes 1:10.</p>

<p><sup></sup></p><br><br></font><font class="second_size_3"><b><a name=$424 href=#-424>19</a></b></font><font class="verdana_size_1"><sup></sup> [44] Just as the Jewish Christians
received the gift of the Spirit, so too do the Gentiles.</p>
