[<A href=PVA.html#GOSP.MAT.1.1><b>&#8658;</b></A> 1:1-<A href=PVB.html#GOSP.MAT.2.23><b>&#8658;</b></A> 2:23] The infancy
narrative forms the prologue of the gospel. Consisting of a genealogy and five
stories, it presents the coming of Jesus as the climax of Israel's history, and
the events of his conception, birth, and early childhood as the fulfillment of
Old Testament prophecy. The genealogy is probably traditional material that
Matthew edited. In its first two sections (<A href=PVA.html#GOSP.MAT.1.2><b>&#8658;</b></A> Matthew
1:2-11) it was drawn from <A href=P6T.html#PENT.RUT.4.18><b>&#8658;</b></A> Ruth 4:18-22;
1 Chron 1-3. Except for Jechoniah, Shealtiel, and Zerubbabel, none of the names
in the third section (<A href=PVA.html#GOSP.MAT.1.12><b>&#8658;</b></A> Matthew 1:12-16) is found in
any Old Testament genealogy. While the genealogy shows the continuity of God's
providential plan from Abraham on, discontinuity is also present. The women
Tamar (<A href=PVA.html#GOSP.MAT.1.3><b>&#8658;</b></A> Matthew 1:3), Rahab and Ruth
(<A href=PVA.html#GOSP.MAT.1.5><b>&#8658;</b></A> Matthew 1:5), and the wife of Uriah, Bathsheba
(<A href=PVA.html#GOSP.MAT.1.6><b>&#8658;</b></A> Matthew 1:6), bore their sons through unions that
were in varying degrees strange and unexpected. These &quot;irregularities&quot;
culminate in the supreme &quot;irregularity&quot; of the Messiah's birth of a
virgin mother; the age of fulfillment is inaugurated by a creative act of God.
Drawing upon both biblical tradition and Jewish stories, Matthew portrays Jesus
as reliving the Exodus experience of Israel and the persecutions of Moses. His
rejection by his own people and his passion are foreshadowed by the troubled
reaction of &quot;all Jerusalem&quot; to the question of the magi who are
seeking the &quot;newborn king of the Jews&quot; (<A href=PVB.html#GOSP.MAT.2.2><b>&#8658;</b></A> Matthew
2:2-3), and by Herod's attempt to have him killed. The magi who do
him homage prefigure the Gentiles who will accept the preaching of the gospel.
The infancy narrative proclaims who Jesus is, the savior of his people from
their sins (<A href=PVA.html#GOSP.MAT.1.21><b>&#8658;</b></A> Matthew 1:21), Emmanuel in whom
&quot;God is with us&quot; (<A href=PVA.html#GOSP.MAT.1.23><b>&#8658;</b></A> Matthew 1:23), and the
Son of God (<A href=PVB.html#GOSP.MAT.2.15><b>&#8658;</b></A> Matthew 2:15).</p>

Abraham: two links of the genealogical chain are singled out. Although the
later, David is placed first in order to emphasize that Jesus is the royal
Messiah. The mention of Abraham may be due not only to his being the father of
the nation Israel but to Matthew's interest in the universal scope of Jesus'
mission; cf <A href=PO.html#PENT.GEN.22.18><b>&#8658;</b></A> Genesis 22:18 &quot;. . . . in your
descendants all the nations of the earth shall find blessing.&quot; </p>

Asaph but Asa (see <A href=P9T.html#HIS.1CHR.3.10><b>&#8658;</b></A> 1 Chron 3:10). Some textual
witnesses read the latter name; however, Asaph is better attested. Matthew may
have deliberately introduced the psalmist Asaph into the genealogy (and in
<A href=PVA.html#GOSP.MAT.1.10><b>&#8658;</b></A> Matthew 1:10 the prophet Amos) in order to show
that Jesus is the fulfillment not only of the promises made to David (see 2 Sam
7) but of all the Old Testament.</p>

fourteen generations, probably because fourteen is the numerical value of the
Hebrew letters forming the name of David. In the second section of the
genealogy (<A href=PVA.html#GOSP.MAT.1.6><b>&#8658;</b></A> Matthew 1:6b-11), three kings of Judah,
Ahaziah, Joash, and Amaziah, have been omitted (see <A href=P9T.html#HIS.1CHR.3.11><b>&#8658;</b></A> 1 Chron
3:11-12), so that there are fourteen generations in that section. Yet
the third (<A href=PVA.html#GOSP.MAT.1.12><b>&#8658;</b></A> Matthew 1:12-16) apparently has only
thirteen. Since Matthew here emphasizes that each section has fourteen, it is
unlikely that the thirteen of the last was due to his oversight. Some scholars
suggest that Jesus who is called the Messiah (<A href=PVA.html#GOSP.MAT.1.16><b>&#8658;</b></A> Matthew
1:16b) doubles the final member of the chain: Jesus, born within the
family of David, opens up the new age as Messiah, so that in fact there are
fourteen generations in the third section. This is perhaps too subtle, and the
hypothesis of a slip not on the part of Matthew but of a later scribe seems
likely. On Messiah, see the note on <A href=PWL.html#GOSP.LUK.2.11><b>&#8658;</b></A> Luke 2:11.</p>

<A href=PVA.html#GOSP.MAT.1.16><b>&#8658;</b></A> Matthew 1:16. The virginal conception of Jesus is
the work of the Spirit of God. Joseph's decision to divorce Mary is overcome by
the heavenly command that he take her into his home and accept the child as his
own. The natural genealogical line is broken but the promises to David are fulfilled;
through Joseph's adoption the child belongs to the family of David. Matthew
sees the virginal conception as the fulfillment of <A href=PNQ.html#PROPHB.ISA.7.14><b>&#8658;</b></A> Isaiah

required him to do so, but the texts usually given in support of that view,
e.g., <A href=P51.html#PENT.DEU.22.20><b>&#8658;</b></A> Deut 22:20-21 do not clearly pertain to
Joseph's situation. Unwilling to expose her to shame: the penalty for proved
adultery was death by stoning; cf <A href=P51.html#PENT.DEU.22.21><b>&#8658;</b></A> Deut 22:21-23.</p>
