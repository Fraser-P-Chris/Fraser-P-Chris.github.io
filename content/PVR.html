book of the gospel is often called the &quot;church order&quot; discourse, but
it lacks most of the considerations usually connected with church order, such
as various offices in the church and the duties of each, and deals principally
with the relations that must obtain among the members of the church. Beginning
with the warning that greatness in the kingdom of heaven is measured not by
rank or power but by childlikeness (<A href=PVR.html#GOSP.MAT.18.1><b>&#8658;</b></A> Matthew 18:1-5),
it deals with the care that the disciples must take not to cause the little
ones to sin or to neglect them if they stray from the community
(<A href=PVR.html#GOSP.MAT.18.6><b>&#8658;</b></A> Matthew 18:6-14), the correction of members who
sin (<A href=PVR.html#GOSP.MAT.18.15><b>&#8658;</b></A> Matthew 18:15-18), the efficacy of the
prayer of the disciples because of the presence of Jesus
(<A href=PVR.html#GOSP.MAT.18.19><b>&#8658;</b></A> Matthew 18:19-20), and the forgiveness that must
be repeatedly extended to sinful members who repent
(<A href=PVR.html#GOSP.MAT.18.21><b>&#8658;</b></A> Matthew 18:21-35).</p>

i.e., after the parousia and the final judgment. But what follows about causes
of sin, church discipline, and forgiveness, all dealing with the present age,
suggests that the question has to do with rank also in the church, where the

anticipation; see the notes on <A href=PVC.html#GOSP.MAT.3.2><b>&#8658;</b></A> Matthew 3:2;

passes from the child of <A href=PVR.html#GOSP.MAT.18.2><b>&#8658;</b></A> Matthew 18:2-4 to the
disciples, little ones because of their becoming like children. It is difficult
to know whether this is a designation of all who are disciples or of those who
are insignificant in contrast to others, e.g., the leaders of the community.
Since apart from this chapter the designation little ones occurs in Matthew
only in <A href=PVJ.html#GOSP.MAT.10.42><b>&#8658;</b></A> Matthew 10:42 where it means disciples as
such, that is its more likely meaning here. Who believe in me: since
discipleship is impossible without at least some degree of faith, this further
specification seems superfluous. However, it serves to indicate that the
warning against causing a little one to sin is principally directed against
whatever would lead such a one to a weakening or loss of faith. The Greek verb
skandalizein, here translated causes . . . to sin, means literally &quot;causes
to stumble&quot;; what the stumbling is depends on the context. It is used of
falling away from faith in <A href=PVM.html#GOSP.MAT.13.21><b>&#8658;</b></A> Matthew 13:21.
According to the better reading of <A href=PWB.html#GOSP.MAR.9.42><b>&#8658;</b></A> Mark 9:42, in
me is a Matthean addition to the Marcan source. It would be better . . . depths
of the sea: cf <A href=PWB.html#GOSP.MAR.9.42><b>&#8658;</b></A> Mark 9:42.</p>

<p><sup></sup></p><br><br></font><font class="second_size_3"><b><a name=$34K href=#-34K>6</a></b></font><font class="verdana_size_1"><sup></sup> [7] This is a Q saying; cf
<A href=PX0.html#GOSP.LUK.17.1><b>&#8658;</b></A> Luke 17:1. The inevitability of things that cause
sin (literally, &quot;scandals&quot;) does not take away the responsibility of
the one through whom they come. <A href=PVR.html#GOSP.MAT.18.8><b>&#8658;</b></A> Matthew 18:8-9</p>

<p><sup></sup></p><br><br></font><font class="second_size_3"><b><a name=$34L href=#-34L>7</a></b></font><font class="verdana_size_1"><sup></sup> [8] These verses are a doublet of
<A href=PVE.html#GOSP.MAT.5.29><b>&#8658;</b></A> Matthew 5:29-30. In that context they have to do
with causes of sexual sin. As in the Marcan source from which they have been
drawn (<A href=PWB.html#GOSP.MAR.9.42><b>&#8658;</b></A> Mark 9:42-48), they differ from the first
warning about scandal, which deals with causing another person to sin, for they
concern what causes oneself to sin and they do not seem to be related to
another's loss of faith, as the first warning is. It is difficult to know how
Matthew understood the logical connection between these verses and
<A href=PVR.html#GOSP.MAT.18.6><b>&#8658;</b></A> Matthew 18:6-7.</p>

<p><sup></sup></p><br><br></font><font class="second_size_3"><b><a name=$34M href=#-34M>8</a></b></font><font class="verdana_size_1"><sup></sup> [10-14] The first and last verses
are peculiar to Matthew. The parable itself comes from Q; see
<A href=PWY.html#GOSP.LUK.15.3><b>&#8658;</b></A> Luke 15:3-7. In Luke it serves as justification
for Jesus' table-companionship with sinners; here, it is an exhortation for the
disciples to seek out fellow disciples who have gone astray. Not only must no
one cause a fellow disciple to sin, but those who have strayed must be sought
out and, if possible, brought back to the community. The joy of the shepherd on
finding the sheep, though not absent in <A href=PVR.html#GOSP.MAT.18.13><b>&#8658;</b></A> Matthew
18:13 is more emphasized in Luke. By his addition of <A href=PVR.html#GOSP.MAT.18.10><b>&#8658;</b></A> Matthew
18:10, <A href=PVR.html#GOSP.MAT.18.14><b>&#8658;</b></A> 14 Matthew has drawn out
explicitly the application of the parable to the care of the little ones.</p>

&quot;For the Son of Man has come to save what was lost&quot;; cf
<A href=PVI.html#GOSP.MAT.9.13><b>&#8658;</b></A> Matthew 9:13. This is practically identical with
<A href=PX2.html#GOSP.LUK.19.10><b>&#8658;</b></A> Luke 19:10 and is probably a copyist's addition
from that source.</p>

Christian disciples toward those who have strayed from their number, the
discourse now turns to how they are to deal with one who sins and yet remains
within the community. First there is to be private correction
(<A href=PVR.html#GOSP.MAT.18.15><b>&#8658;</b></A> Matthew 18:15); if this is unsuccessful, further
correction before two or three witnesses (<A href=PVR.html#GOSP.MAT.18.16><b>&#8658;</b></A> Matthew
18:16); if this fails, the matter is to be brought before the
assembled community (the church), and if the sinner refuses to attend to the
correction of the church, he is to be expelled (<A href=PVR.html#GOSP.MAT.18.17><b>&#8658;</b></A> Matthew
18:17). The church's judgment will be ratified in heaven, i.e., by
God (<A href=PVR.html#GOSP.MAT.18.18><b>&#8658;</b></A> Matthew 18:18). This three-step process of
correction corresponds, though not exactly, to the procedure of the Qumran
community; see 1QS 5:25-6:1; 6:24-7:25; CD 9:2-8. The section ends with a
saying about the favorable response of God to prayer, even to that of a very
small number, for Jesus is in the midst of any gathering of his disciples,
however small (<A href=PVR.html#GOSP.MAT.18.19><b>&#8658;</b></A> Matthew 18:19-20). Whether this
prayer has anything to do with the preceding judgment is uncertain.</p>

against you, are widely attested but they are not in the important codices
Sinaiticus and Vaticanus or in some other textual witnesses. Their omission
broadens the type of sin in question. Won over: literally, &quot;gained.&quot;</p>

only two instances of this word in the gospels; see the note on
<A href=PVP.html#GOSP.MAT.16.18><b>&#8658;</b></A> Matthew 16:18. Here it refers not to the entire
church of Jesus, as in <A href=PVP.html#GOSP.MAT.16.18><b>&#8658;</b></A> Matthew 16:18, but to the
local congregation. Treat him . . . a Gentile or a tax collector: just as the
observant Jew avoided the company of Gentiles and tax collectors, so must the
congregation of Christian disciples separate itself from the arrogantly sinful
member who refuses to repent even when convicted of his sin by the whole
church. Such a one is to be set outside the fellowship of the community. The
harsh language about Gentile and tax collector probably reflects a stage of the
Matthean church when it was principally composed of Jewish Christians. That
time had long since passed, but the principle of exclusion for such a sinner
remained. Paul makes a similar demand for excommunication in
<A href=PZA.html#NTLET.1COR.5.1><b>&#8658;</b></A> 1 Cor 5:1-13.</p>

<p><sup></sup></p><br><br></font><font class="second_size_3"><b><a name=$34T href=#-34T>15</a></b></font><font class="verdana_size_1"><sup></sup> [18] Except for the plural of the
verbs bind and loose, this verse is practically identical with
<A href=PVP.html#GOSP.MAT.16.19><b>&#8658;</b></A> Matthew 16:19b and many scholars understand it as
granting to all the disciples what was previously given to Peter alone. For a
different view, based on the different contexts of the two verses, see the note
on <A href=PVP.html#GOSP.MAT.16.19><b>&#8658;</b></A> Matthew 16:19.</p>

to prayer on the occasion of the church's gathering to deal with the sinner of
<A href=PVR.html#GOSP.MAT.18.17><b>&#8658;</b></A> Matthew 18:17. Unless an a fortiori argument is
supposed, this seems unlikely. God's answer to the prayer of two or three
envisages a different situation from one that involves the entire congregation.
In addition, the object of this prayer is expressed in most general terms as
anything for which they are to pray.</p>

midst of them: the presence of Jesus guarantees the efficacy of the prayer.
This saying is similar to one attributed to a rabbi executed in A.D. 135 at the
time of the second Jewish revolt: &quot;. . . When two sit and there are
between them the words of the Torah, the divine presence (Shekinah) rests upon
them&quot; (Pirqe Abot 3:3).</p>

<p><sup></sup></p><br><br></font><font class="second_size_3"><b><a name=$34W href=#-34W>18</a></b></font><font class="verdana_size_1"><sup></sup> [21-35] The final section of the
discourse deals with the forgiveness that the disciples are to give to their
fellow disciples who sin against them. To the question of Peter how often
forgiveness is to be granted (<A href=PVR.html#GOSP.MAT.18.21><b>&#8658;</b></A> Matthew 18:21),
Jesus answers that it is to be given without limit (<A href=PVR.html#GOSP.MAT.18.22><b>&#8658;</b></A> Matthew
18:22) and illustrates this with the parable of the unmerciful
servant (<A href=PVR.html#GOSP.MAT.18.23><b>&#8658;</b></A> Matthew 18:23-34), warning that his
heavenly Father will give those who do not forgive the same treatment as that
given to the unmerciful servant (<A href=PVR.html#GOSP.MAT.18.35><b>&#8658;</b></A> Matthew 18:35).
<A href=PVR.html#GOSP.MAT.18.21><b>&#8658;</b></A> Matthew 18:21-22 correspond to <A href=PX0.html#GOSP.LUK.17.4><b>&#8658;</b></A> Luke
17:4; the parable and the final warning are peculiar to Matthew. That
the Parable did not originally belong to this context is suggested by the fact
that it really does not deal with repeated forgiveness, which is the point of
Peter's question and Jesus' reply.</p>

There is probably an allusion, by contrast, to the limitless vengeance of
Lamech in the Genesis text. In any case, what is demanded of the disciples is
limitless forgiveness.</p>

&quot;ten thousand talents.&quot; The talent was a unit of coinage of high but
varying value depending on its metal (gold, silver, copper) and its place of
origin. It is mentioned in the New Testament only here and in
<A href=PVY.html#GOSP.MAT.25.14><b>&#8658;</b></A> Matthew 25:14-30.</p>

forgiveness of God and yet refuses to forgive the relatively minor offenses
done to him.</p>
