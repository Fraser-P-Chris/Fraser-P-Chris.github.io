were to take place in two days' time. So the chief priests and the scribes were
seeking a way to arrest him by treachery and put him to death. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>They said, &quot;Not during the festival, for
fear that there may be a riot among the people.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-3G5 href=#$3G5>2</a></sup></font></sup> When he was in Bethany reclining at table in
the house of Simon the leper, a woman came with an alabaster jar of perfumed
oil, costly genuine spikenard. She broke the alabaster jar and poured it on his
head. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>4
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>There were some who were indignant. &quot;Why
has there been this waste of perfumed oil? </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>5
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>It could have been sold for more than three
hundred days' wages and the money given to the poor.&quot; They were infuriated
with her. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>6
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Jesus said, &quot;Let her alone. Why do you
make trouble for her? She has done a good thing for me. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>7
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The poor you will always have with you, and
whenever you wish you can do good to them, but you will not always have me. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>8
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>She has done what she could. She has
anticipated anointing my body for burial. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>9
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Amen, I say to you, wherever the gospel is
proclaimed to the whole world, what she has done will be told in memory of
her.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>10
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then Judas Iscariot, one of the Twelve, went
off to the chief priests to hand him over to them. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>11
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When they heard him they were pleased and
promised to pay him money. Then he looked for an opportunity to hand him over. </p>

Bread, when they sacrificed the Passover lamb, <sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-3G6 href=#$3G6>3</a></sup></font></sup> his disciples
said to him, &quot;Where do you want us to go and prepare for you to eat the
Passover?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>13
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>He sent two of his disciples and said to them,
&quot;Go into the city and a man will meet you, carrying a jar of water. <sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-3G7 href=#$3G7>4</a></sup></font></sup>
Follow him. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>14
</p>

house, 'The Teacher says, &quot;Where is my guest room where I may eat the
Passover with my disciples?&quot;' </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>15
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then he will show you a large upper room
furnished and ready. Make the preparations for us there.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>16
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The disciples then went off, entered the city,
and found it just as he had told them; and they prepared the Passover. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>17
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When it was evening, he came with the Twelve. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>18
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-3G8 href=#$3G8>5</a></sup></font></sup> And as they reclined at table and were eating,
Jesus said, &quot;Amen, I say to you, one of you will betray me, one who is
eating with me.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>19
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>They began to be distressed and to say to him,
one by one, &quot;Surely it is not I?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>20
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>He said to them, &quot;One of the Twelve, the
one who dips with me into the dish. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>21
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>For the Son of Man indeed goes, as it is
written of him, <sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-3G9 href=#$3G9>6</a></sup></font></sup> but woe to that man by whom the Son of Man
is betrayed. It would be better for that man if he had never been born.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>22
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-3GA href=#$3GA>7</a></sup></font></sup> While they were eating, he took bread, said
the blessing, broke it, and gave it to them, and said, &quot;Take it; this is
my body.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>23
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then he took a cup, gave thanks, and gave it to
them, and they all drank from it. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>24
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>He said to them, &quot;This is my blood of the
covenant, which will be shed <sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-3GB href=#$3GB>8</a></sup></font></sup> for many. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>25
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Amen, I say to you, I shall not drink again the
fruit of the vine until the day when I drink it new in the kingdom of
God.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>26
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then, after singing a hymn, <sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-3GC href=#$3GC>9</a></sup></font></sup>
they went out to the Mount of Olives. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>27
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-3GD href=#$3GD>10</a></sup></font></sup> Then Jesus said to them, &quot;All of you will
have your faith shaken, for it is written: 'I will strike the shepherd, and the
sheep will be dispersed.' </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>28
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But after I have been raised up, I shall go
before you to Galilee.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>29
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Peter said to him, &quot;Even though all should
have their faith shaken, mine will not be.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>30
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then Jesus said to him, &quot;Amen, I say to
you, this very night before the cock crows twice you will deny me three
times.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>31
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But he vehemently replied, &quot;Even though I
should have to die with you, I will not deny you.&quot; And they all spoke
similarly. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>32
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-3GE href=#$3GE>11</a></sup></font></sup> Then they came to a place named Gethsemane,
and he said to his disciples, &quot;Sit here while I pray.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>33
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>He took with him Peter, James, and John, and
began to be troubled and distressed. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>34
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then he said to them, &quot;My soul is
sorrowful even to death. Remain here and keep watch.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>35
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>He advanced a little and fell to the ground and
prayed that if it were possible the hour might pass by him; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>36
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>he said, &quot;Abba, Father, <sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-3GF href=#$3GF>12</a></sup></font></sup>
all things are possible to you. Take this cup away from me, but not what I will
but what you will.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>37
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When he returned he found them asleep. He said
to Peter, &quot;Simon, are you asleep? Could you not keep watch for one hour? </p>

</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-3GG href=#$3GG>13</a></sup></font></sup> Watch and pray that you may not undergo the
test. The spirit is willing but the flesh is weak.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>39
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Withdrawing again, he prayed, saying the same
thing. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>40
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then he returned once more and found them
asleep, for they could not keep their eyes open and did not know what to answer
him. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>41
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>He returned a third time and said to them,
&quot;Are you still sleeping and taking your rest? It is enough. The hour has
come. Behold, the Son of Man is to be handed over to sinners. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>42
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Get up, let us go. See, my betrayer is at
hand.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>43
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then, while he was still speaking, Judas, one
of the Twelve, arrived, accompanied by a crowd with swords and clubs who had
come from the chief priests, the scribes, and the elders. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>44
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>His betrayer had arranged a signal with them,
saying, &quot;The man I shall kiss is the one; arrest him and lead him away
securely.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>45
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>He came and immediately went over to him and
said, &quot;Rabbi.&quot; And he kissed him. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>46
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>At this they laid hands on him and arrested
him. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>47

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>One of the bystanders drew his sword, struck
the high priest's servant, and cut off his ear. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>48
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Jesus said to them in reply, &quot;Have you
come out as against a robber, with swords and clubs, to seize me? </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>49

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Day after day I was with you teaching in the

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Peter followed him at a distance into the high

[1-<A href=__PWI.html#GOSP.MAR.16.8><b>&#8658;</b></A> 16:8] In the movement of Mark's gospel the
cross is depicted as Jesus' way to glory in accordance with the divine will.
Thus the passion narrative is seen as the climax of Jesus' ministry. 14, 1: The
Passover and the Feast of Unleavened Bread: the connection between the two
festivals is reflected in <A href=__P1T.html#PENT.EXO.12.3><b>&#8658;</b></A> Exodus 12:3-20;
<A href=__P2F.html#PENT.EXO.34.18><b>&#8658;</b></A> 34:18; <A href=__P39.html#PENT.LEV.23.4><b>&#8658;</b></A> Lev 23:4-8;

16:1-8. The Passover commemorated the redemption from slavery and the
departure of the Israelites from Egypt by night. It began at sundown after the
Passover lamb was sacrificed in the temple in the afternoon of the fourteenth
day of the month of Nisan. With the Passover supper on the same evening was
associated the eating of unleavened bread. The latter was continued through
Nisan 21, a reminder of the affliction of the Israelites and of the haste
surrounding their departure. Praise and thanks to God for his goodness in the
past were combined at this dual festival with the hope of future salvation. The
chief priests . . . to death: the intent to put Jesus to death was plotted for
a long time but delayed for fear of the crowd (<A href=__PW5.html#GOSP.MAR.3.6><b>&#8658;</b></A> Mark
3:6; <A href=__PWD.html#GOSP.MAR.11.18><b>&#8658;</b></A> 11:18;
<A href=__PWE.html#GOSP.MAR.12.12><b>&#8658;</b></A> 12:12). </p>

<p><sup></sup></p><br><br></font><font size=3><b><a name=$3G5 href=#-3G5>2</a></b></font><font face=Verdana size=1><sup></sup> [3] At Bethany on the Mount of
Olives, a few miles from Jerusalem, in the house of Simon the leper, Jesus
defends a woman's loving action of anointing his head with perfumed oil in view
of his impending death and burial as a criminal, in which case his body would
not be anointed. See further the note on <A href=__PXK.html#GOSP.JOH.12.7><b>&#8658;</b></A> John
12:7. He assures the woman of the remembrance of her deed in the
worldwide preaching of the good news.</p>

<p><sup></sup></p><br><br></font><font size=3><b><a name=$3G6 href=#-3G6>3</a></b></font><font face=Verdana size=1><sup></sup> [12] The first day of the Feast of
Unleavened Bread . . . the Passover lamb: a less precise designation of the day
for sacrificing the Passover lamb as evidenced by some rabbinical literature.
For a more exact designation, see the note on <A href=__PWG.html#GOSP.MAR.14.1><b>&#8658;</b></A> Mark
14:1. It was actually Nisan 14.</p>

<p><sup></sup></p><br><br></font><font size=3><b><a name=$3G7 href=#-3G7>4</a></b></font><font face=Verdana size=1><sup></sup> [13] A man . . . carrying a jar of
water: perhaps a prearranged signal, for only women ordinarily carried water in
jars. The Greek word used here, however, implies simply a person and not
necessarily a male.</p>

<p><sup></sup></p><br><br></font><font size=3><b><a name=$3G8 href=#-3G8>5</a></b></font><font face=Verdana size=1><sup></sup> [18] One of you will betray me, one
who is eating with me: contrasts the intimacy of table fellowship at the
Passover meal with the treachery of the traitor; cf <A href=__PGX.html#WISDB.PSA.41.10><b>&#8658;</b></A> Psalm
41:10.</p>

<p><sup></sup></p><br><br></font><font size=3><b><a name=$3G9 href=#-3G9>6</a></b></font><font face=Verdana size=1><sup></sup> [21] The Son of Man indeed goes, as
it is written of him: a reference to <A href=__PGX.html#WISDB.PSA.41.10><b>&#8658;</b></A> Psalm 41:10
cited by Jesus concerning Judas at the Last Supper; cf <A href=__PXL.html#GOSP.JOH.13.18><b>&#8658;</b></A> John
13:18-19.</p>

<p><sup></sup></p><br><br></font><font size=3><b><a name=$3GA href=#-3GA>7</a></b></font><font face=Verdana size=1><sup></sup> [22-24] The actions and words of
Jesus express within the framework of the Passover meal and the transition to a
new covenant the sacrifice of himself through the offering of his body and
blood in anticipation of his passion and death. His blood of the covenant both
alludes to the ancient rite of <A href=__P25.html#PENT.EXO.24.4><b>&#8658;</b></A> Exodus 24:4-8 and
indicates the new community that the sacrifice of Jesus will bring into being
(<A href=__PVZ.html#GOSP.MAT.26.26><b>&#8658;</b></A> Matthew 26:26-28; <A href=__PX5.html#GOSP.LUK.22.19><b>&#8658;</b></A> Luke

note on <A href=__PVZ.html#GOSP.MAT.26.27><b>&#8658;</b></A> Matthew 26:27-28. For many: the Greek
preposition hyper is a different one from that at <A href=__PVZ.html#GOSP.MAT.26.28><b>&#8658;</b></A> Matthew
26:28 but the same as that found at <A href=__PX5.html#GOSP.LUK.22.19><b>&#8658;</b></A> Luke
22:19, <A href=__PX5.html#GOSP.LUK.22.20><b>&#8658;</b></A> 20 and <A href=__PZG.html#NTLET.1COR.11.24><b>&#8658;</b></A> 1
Cor 11:24. The sense of both words is vicarious, and it is difficult
in Hellenistic Greek to distinguish between them. For many in the sense of
&quot;all,&quot; see the note on <A href=__PVT.html#GOSP.MAT.20.28><b>&#8658;</b></A> Matthew 20:28.</p>

<p><sup></sup></p><br><br></font><font size=3><b><a name=$3GC href=#-3GC>9</a></b></font><font face=Verdana size=1><sup></sup> [26] After singing a hymn: Psalm
114-118, thanksgiving songs concluding the Passover meal.</p>

<p><sup></sup></p><br><br></font><font size=3><b><a name=$3GD href=#-3GD>10</a></b></font><font face=Verdana size=1><sup></sup> [27-31] Jesus predicted that the
Twelve would waver in their faith, even abandon him, despite their
protestations to the contrary. Yet he reassured them that after his
resurrection he would regather them in Galilee (<A href=__PWI.html#GOSP.MAR.16.7><b>&#8658;</b></A> Mark
16:7; cf <A href=__PVZ.html#GOSP.MAT.26.32><b>&#8658;</b></A> Matthew 26:32;

<A href=__PW1.html#GOSP.MAT.28.16><b>&#8658;</b></A> 16; John 21), where he first summoned them to be
his followers as he began to preach the good news (<A href=__PW3.html#GOSP.MAR.1.14><b>&#8658;</b></A> Mark
1:14-20).</p>

<p><sup></sup></p><br><br></font><font size=3><b><a name=$3GE href=#-3GE>11</a></b></font><font face=Verdana size=1><sup></sup> [32-34] The disciples who had
witnessed the raising to life of the daughter of Jairus (<A href=__PW7.html#GOSP.MAR.5.37><b>&#8658;</b></A> Mark
5:37) and the transfiguration of their Master (<A href=__PWB.html#GOSP.MAR.9.2><b>&#8658;</b></A> Mark
9:2) were now invited to witness his degradation and agony and to
watch and pray with him.</p>

<p><sup></sup></p><br><br></font><font size=3><b><a name=$3GF href=#-3GF>12</a></b></font><font face=Verdana size=1><sup></sup> [36] Abba, Father: an Aramaic term,
here also translated by Mark, Jesus' special way of addressing God with filial
intimacy. The word abba seems not to have been used in earlier or
contemporaneous Jewish sources to address God without some qualifier. Cf
<A href=__PYW.html#NTLET.ROM.8.15><b>&#8658;</b></A> Romans 8:15; <A href=__P104.html#NTLET.GAL.4.6><b>&#8658;</b></A> Gal 4:6
for other occurrences of the Aramaic word in the Greek New Testament. Not what
I will but what you will: note the complete obedient surrender of the human
will of Jesus to the divine will of the Father; cf <A href=__PXC.html#GOSP.JOH.4.34><b>&#8658;</b></A> John
4:34; <A href=__PXG.html#GOSP.JOH.8.29><b>&#8658;</b></A> 8:29; <A href=__PYT.html#NTLET.ROM.5.19><b>&#8658;</b></A> Romans

<p><sup></sup></p><br><br></font><font size=3><b><a name=$3GG href=#-3GG>13</a></b></font><font face=Verdana size=1><sup></sup> [38] The spirit is willing but the
flesh is weak: the spirit is drawn to what is good yet found in conflict with
the flesh, inclined to sin; cf <A href=__PH7.html#WISDB.PSA.51.5><b>&#8658;</b></A> Psalm 51:5,
<A href=__PH7.html#WISDB.PSA.51.10><b>&#8658;</b></A> 10. Everyone is faced with this struggle, the
full force of which Jesus accepted on our behalf and, through his bitter
passion and death, achieved the victory.</p>

together: Mark presents a formal assembly of the whole Sanhedrin (chief
priests, elders, and scribes) at night, leading to the condemnation of Jesus
(<A href=__PWG.html#GOSP.MAR.14.64><b>&#8658;</b></A> Mark 14:64), in contrast to
<A href=__PX5.html#GOSP.LUK.22.66><b>&#8658;</b></A> Luke 22:66, <A href=__PX5.html#GOSP.LUK.22.71><b>&#8658;</b></A> 71
where Jesus is condemned in a daytime meeting of the council; see also

Jesus' acknowledgment that he is the Messiah and Son of God; cf

7:13 and <A href=__PIU.html#WISDB.PSA.110.1><b>&#8658;</b></A> Psalm 110:1 portending the
