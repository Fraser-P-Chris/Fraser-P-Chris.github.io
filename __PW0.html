the chief priests and the elders of the people took counsel against Jesus to
put him to death. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>They bound him, led him away, and handed him
over to Pilate, the governor. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>3
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then Judas, his betrayer, seeing that Jesus had
been condemned, deeply regretted what he had done. He returned the thirty
pieces of silver <sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-3AQ href=#$3AQ>3</a></sup></font></sup> to the chief priests and elders, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>4
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>saying, &quot;I have sinned in betraying
innocent blood.&quot; They said, &quot;What is that to us? Look to it
yourself.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>5
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-3AR href=#$3AR>4</a></sup></font></sup> Flinging the money into the temple, he
departed and went off and hanged himself. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>6
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The chief priests gathered up the money, but
said, &quot;It is not lawful to deposit this in the temple treasury, for it is
the price of blood.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>7
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>After consultation, they used it to buy the
potter's field as a burial place for foreigners. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>8
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>That is why that field even today is called the
Field of Blood. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>9
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then was fulfilled what had been said through
Jeremiah the prophet, <sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-3AS href=#$3AS>5</a></sup></font></sup> &quot;And they took the thirty
pieces of silver, the value of a man with a price on his head, a price set by
some of the Israelites, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>10
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>and they paid it out for the potter's field
just as the Lord had commanded me.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>11
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Now Jesus stood before the governor, and he
questioned him, &quot;Are you the king of the Jews?&quot; <sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-3AT href=#$3AT>6</a></sup></font></sup>
Jesus said, &quot;You say so.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>12
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>And when he was accused by the chief priests
and elders, <sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-3AU href=#$3AU>7</a></sup></font></sup> he made no answer. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>13
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then Pilate said to him, &quot;Do you not hear
how many things they are testifying against you?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>14
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But he did not answer him one word, so that the
governor was greatly amazed. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>15
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-3AV href=#$3AV>8</a></sup></font></sup> Now on the occasion of the feast the governor
was accustomed to release to the crowd one prisoner whom they wished. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>16
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-3AW href=#$3AW>9</a></sup></font></sup> And at that time they had a notorious prisoner
called (Jesus) Barabbas. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>17
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>So when they had assembled, Pilate said to
them, &quot;Which one do you want me to release to you, (Jesus) Barabbas, or
Jesus called Messiah?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>18
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-3AX href=#$3AX>10</a></sup></font></sup> For he knew that it was out of envy that they
had handed him over. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>19
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-3AY href=#$3AY>11</a></sup></font></sup> While he was still seated on the bench, his
wife sent him a message, &quot;Have nothing to do with that righteous man. I
suffered much in a dream today because of him.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>20
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The chief priests and the elders persuaded the
crowds to ask for Barabbas but to destroy Jesus. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>21
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The governor said to them in reply, &quot;Which
of the two do you want me to release to you?&quot; They answered,
&quot;Barabbas!&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>22
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-3AZ href=#$3AZ>12</a></sup></font></sup> Pilate said to them, &quot;Then what shall I
do with Jesus called Messiah?&quot; They all said, &quot;Let him be
crucified!&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>23
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But he said, &quot;Why? What evil has he
done?&quot; They only shouted the louder, &quot;Let him be crucified!&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>24
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-3B0 href=#$3B0>13</a></sup></font></sup> When Pilate saw that he was not succeeding at
all, but that a riot was breaking out instead, he took water and washed his
hands in the sight of the crowd, saying, &quot;I am innocent of this man's
blood. Look to it yourselves.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>25
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>And the whole people said in reply, &quot;His
blood be upon us and upon our children.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>26
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then he released Barabbas to them, but after he
had Jesus scourged, <sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-3B1 href=#$3B1>14</a></sup></font></sup> he handed him over to be crucified. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>27
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then the soldiers of the governor took Jesus
inside the praetorium <sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-3B2 href=#$3B2>15</a></sup></font></sup> and gathered the whole cohort
around him. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>28
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>They stripped off his clothes and threw a
scarlet military cloak <sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-3B3 href=#$3B3>16</a></sup></font></sup> about him. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>29
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Weaving a crown out of thorns, <sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-3B4 href=#$3B4>17</a></sup></font></sup>
they placed it on his head, and a reed in his right hand. And kneeling before
him, they mocked him, saying, &quot;Hail, King of the Jews!&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>30
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>They spat upon him <sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-3B5 href=#$3B5>18</a></sup></font></sup> and
took the reed and kept striking him on the head. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>31
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>And when they had mocked him, they stripped him
of the cloak, dressed him in his own clothes, and led him off to crucify him. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>32
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-3B6 href=#$3B6>19</a></sup></font></sup> As they were going out, they met a Cyrenian
named Simon; this man they pressed into service to carry his cross. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>33
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>And when they came to a place called Golgotha
(which means Place of the Skull), </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>34
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>they gave Jesus wine to drink mixed with gall. <sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-3B7 href=#$3B7>20</a></sup></font></sup>
But when he had tasted it, he refused to drink. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>35
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>After they had crucified him, they divided his
garments <sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-3B8 href=#$3B8>21</a></sup></font></sup> by casting lots; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>36
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>then they sat down and kept watch over him
there. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>37
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>And they placed over his head the written
charge <sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-3B9 href=#$3B9>22</a></sup></font></sup> against him: This is Jesus, the King of the Jews. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>38
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Two revolutionaries <sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-3BA href=#$3BA>23</a></sup></font></sup> were
crucified with him, one on his right and the other on his left. </p>

</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-3BB href=#$3BB>24</a></sup></font></sup> Those passing by reviled him, shaking their

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>and saying, &quot;You who would destroy the
temple and rebuild it in three days, save yourself, if you are the Son of God,
(and) come down from the cross!&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>41
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Likewise the chief priests with the scribes and
elders mocked him and said, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>42
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;He saved others; he cannot save himself.
So he is the king of Israel! <sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-3BC href=#$3BC>25</a></sup></font></sup> Let him come down from the

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-3BD href=#$3BD>26</a></sup></font></sup> He trusted in God; let him deliver him now if

<p class=MsoNormal>44
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The revolutionaries who were crucified with him
also kept abusing him in the same way. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-3BE href=#$3BE>27</a></sup></font></sup> From noon onward, darkness came over the whole

means, &quot;My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Immediately one of them ran to get a sponge; he
soaked it in wine, and putting it on a reed, gave it to him to drink. </p>

putting their death sentence against Jesus into effect since they lacked the right
to do so themselves. Others see it as the occasion for their passing that
sentence, holding that Matthew, unlike Mark (<A href=__PWG.html#GOSP.MAR.14.64><b>&#8658;</b></A> Mark

session (<A href=__PVZ.html#GOSP.MAT.26.66><b>&#8658;</b></A> Matthew 26:66). Even in the latter
interpretation, their handing him over to Pilate is best explained on the

In Acts Judas himself buys the field and its name comes from his own blood shed

custom of releasing at the Passover feast one prisoner chosen by the crowd
(<A href=__PW0.html#GOSP.MAT.27.15><b>&#8658;</b></A> Matthew 27:15). This custom is mentioned also in
<A href=__PWH.html#GOSP.MAR.15.6><b>&#8658;</b></A> Mark 15:6 and <A href=__PXQ.html#GOSP.JOH.18.39><b>&#8658;</b></A> John

possible that the double name is the original reading; Jesus was a common
Jewish name; see the note on <A href=__PVA.html#GOSP.MAT.1.21><b>&#8658;</b></A> Matthew 1:21. This
reading is found in only a few textual witnesses, although its absence in the
majority can be explained as an omission of Jesus made for reverential reasons.
That name is bracketed because of its uncertain textual attestation. The
Aramaic name Barabbas means &quot;son of the father&quot;; the irony of the
choice offered between him and Jesus, the true son of the Father, would be
evident to those addressees of Matthew who knew that.</p>

The responsibility for Jesus' death is accepted by the nation that was God's
special possession (<A href=__P20.html#PENT.EXO.19.5><b>&#8658;</b></A> Exodus 19:5), his own people
(Hosea 2:23), and they thereby lose that high

verse. The controversy between Matthew's church and Pharisaic Judaism about
which was the true people of God is reflected here. As the Second Vatican

Jews of his time or to any Jews of later times.</p>

of those in distress, but the evidences of that belief are all later than the
gospels.</p>

<p><sup></sup></p><br><br></font><font size=3><b><a name=$3BH href=#-3BH>30</a></b></font><font face=Verdana size=1><sup></sup> [50] Gave up his spirit: cf the
Marcan parallel (<A href=__PWH.html#GOSP.MAR.15.37><b>&#8658;</b></A> Mark 15:37), &quot;breathed his
last.&quot; Matthew's alteration expresses both Jesus' control over his destiny
and his obedient giving up of his life to God.</p>

<p><sup></sup></p><br><br></font><font size=3><b><a name=$3BI href=#-3BI>31</a></b></font><font face=Verdana size=1><sup></sup> [51-53] Veil of the sanctuary . . .
bottom: cf <A href=__PWH.html#GOSP.MAR.15.38><b>&#8658;</b></A> Mark 15:38; <A href=__PX6.html#GOSP.LUK.23.45><b>&#8658;</b></A> Luke
23:45. Luke puts this event immediately before the death of Jesus.
There were two veils in the Mosaic tabernacle on the model of which the temple
was constructed, the outer one before the entrance of the Holy Place and the
inner one before the Holy of Holies (see <A href=__P27.html#PENT.EXO.26.31><b>&#8658;</b></A> Exodus
26:31-36). Only the high priest could pass through the latter and
that only on the Day of Atonement (see <A href=__P32.html#PENT.LEV.16.1><b>&#8658;</b></A> Lev
16:1-18). Probably the torn veil of the gospels is the inner one. The
meaning of the scene may be that now, because of Jesus' death, all people have
access to the presence of God, or that the temple, its holiest part standing
exposed, is now profaned and will soon be destroyed. The earth quaked . . .
appeared to many: peculiar to Matthew. The earthquake, the splitting of the
rocks, and especially the resurrection of the dead saints indicate the coming
of the final age. In the Old Testament the coming of God is frequently
portrayed with the imagery of an earthquake (see <A href=__PHO.html#WISDB.PSA.68.9><b>&#8658;</b></A> Psalm
68:9; <A href=__PHX.html#WISDB.PSA.77.19><b>&#8658;</b></A> 77:19), and Jesus speaks of the
earthquakes that will accompany the &quot;labor pains&quot; that signify the
beginning of the dissolution of the old world (<A href=__PVX.html#GOSP.MAT.24.7><b>&#8658;</b></A> Matthew
24:7-8). For the expectation of the resurrection of the dead at the
coming of the new and final age, see <A href=__PSX.html#PROPHB.DAN.12.1><b>&#8658;</b></A> Daniel
12:1-3. Matthew knows that the end of the old age has not yet come
(<A href=__PW1.html#GOSP.MAT.28.20><b>&#8658;</b></A> Matthew 28:20), but the new age has broken in
with the death (and resurrection; cf the earthquake in
<A href=__PW1.html#GOSP.MAT.28.2><b>&#8658;</b></A> Matthew 28:2) of Jesus; see the note on
<A href=__PVP.html#GOSP.MAT.16.28><b>&#8658;</b></A> Matthew 16:28. After his resurrection: this
qualification seems to be due to Matthew's wish to assert the primacy of Jesus'
resurrection even though he has placed the resurrection of the dead saints
immediately after Jesus' death.</p>

<p><sup></sup></p><br><br></font><font size=3><b><a name=$3BJ href=#-3BJ>32</a></b></font><font face=Verdana size=1><sup></sup> [54] Cf <A href=__PWH.html#GOSP.MAR.15.39><b>&#8658;</b></A> Mark
15:39. The
Christian confession of faith is made by Gentiles, not only the centurion, as
in Mark, but the other soldiers who were keeping watch over Jesus (cf
<A href=__PW0.html#GOSP.MAT.27.36><b>&#8658;</b></A> Matthew 27:36).</p>

<p><sup></sup></p><br><br></font><font size=3><b><a name=$3BK href=#-3BK>33</a></b></font><font face=Verdana size=1><sup></sup> [55-56] Looking on from a distance:
cf <A href=__PGU.html#WISDB.PSA.38.12><b>&#8658;</b></A> Psalm 38:12. Mary Magdalene . . . Joseph:
these two women are mentioned again in <A href=__PW0.html#GOSP.MAT.27.61><b>&#8658;</b></A> Matthew
27:61 and <A href=__PW1.html#GOSP.MAT.28.1><b>&#8658;</b></A> Matthew 28:1 and are important
as witnesses of the reality of the empty tomb. A James and Joseph are referred
to in <A href=__PVM.html#GOSP.MAT.13.55><b>&#8658;</b></A> Matthew 13:55 as brothers of Jesus.</p>

<p><sup></sup></p><br><br></font><font size=3><b><a name=$3BL href=#-3BL>34</a></b></font><font face=Verdana size=1><sup></sup> [57-61] Cf <A href=__PWH.html#GOSP.MAR.15.42><b>&#8658;</b></A> Mark
15:42-47. Matthew
drops Mark's designation of Joseph of Arimathea as &quot;a distinguished member
of the council&quot; (the Sanhedrin), and makes him a rich man and a disciple
of Jesus. The former may be an allusion to <A href=__PP0.html#PROPHB.ISA.53.9><b>&#8658;</b></A> Isaiah
53:9 (the Hebrew reading of that text is disputed and the one
followed in the NAB OT has nothing about the rich, but they are mentioned in
the LXX version). That the tomb was the new tomb of a rich man and that it was
seen by the women are indications of an apologetic intent of Matthew; there
could be no question about the identity of Jesus' burial place. The other Mary:
the mother of James and Joseph (56).</p>

<p><sup></sup></p><br><br></font><font size=3><b><a name=$3BM href=#-3BM>35</a></b></font><font face=Verdana size=1><sup></sup> [62-66] Peculiar to Matthew. The
story prepares for <A href=__PW1.html#GOSP.MAT.28.11><b>&#8658;</b></A> Matthew 28:11-15 and the
Jewish charge that the tomb was empty because the disciples had stolen the body
of Jesus (<A href=__PW1.html#GOSP.MAT.28.13><b>&#8658;</b></A> Matthew 28:13,
<A href=__PW1.html#GOSP.MAT.28.15><b>&#8658;</b></A> 15).</p>

<p><sup></sup></p><br><br></font><font size=3><b><a name=$3BN href=#-3BN>36</a></b></font><font face=Verdana size=1><sup></sup> [62] The next day . . .
preparation: the sabbath. According to the synoptic chronology, in that year
the day of preparation (for the sabbath) was the Passover; cf
<A href=__PWH.html#GOSP.MAR.15.42><b>&#8658;</b></A> Mark 15:42. The Pharisees: the principal
opponents of Jesus during his ministry and, in Matthew's time, of the Christian
church, join with the chief priests to guarantee against a possible attempt of
Jesus' disciples to steal his body.</p>

<p><sup></sup></p><br><br></font><font size=3><b><a name=$3BO href=#-3BO>37</a></b></font><font face=Verdana size=1><sup></sup> [64] This last imposture . . . the
first: the claim that Jesus has been raised from the dead is clearly the last
imposture; the first may be either his claim that he would be raised up (63) or
his claim that he was the one with whose ministry the kingdom of God had come
(see <A href=__PVL.html#GOSP.MAT.12.28><b>&#8658;</b></A> Matthew 12:28).</p>

<p><sup></sup></p><br><br></font><font size=3><b><a name=$3BP href=#-3BP>38</a></b></font><font face=Verdana size=1><sup></sup> [65] The guard is yours: literally,
&quot;have a guard&quot; or &quot;you have a guard.&quot; Either the imperative
or the indicative could mean that Pilate granted the petitioners some Roman
soldiers as guards, which is the sense of the present translation. However, if
the verb is taken as an indicative it could also mean that Pilate told them to
use their own Jewish guards.</p>
